Suki tte Ii na yo.

add



As an avid fan of romantic anime, Suki tte Ii na yo quickly became one of my favorite series. I was immediately drawn in by the main character, Mei Tachibana, and her struggles to open up to others and trust after a traumatic childhood incident. Her journey towards self-discovery and learning to trust again was both relatable and inspiring.

The series...

Plastic Memories

""I hope that you will be reunited with the one that you cherish"" - Isla

Plastic memories tell a well-paced and subtle story with a great message. The world takes place with the idea of the Giftia, which is essentially an AI that isn't human but can mock human feelings. Isla is a Giftia and the journey that she takes throughout the series is one that...

Taishou Otome Otogibanashi

I'm not sure why the top featured review is a rant about female authors and calling this show an incel show but it's clearly just a romance anime. in short, nothing new or revolutionary. but it's also not the worst out there.

Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Outside Legend - The Endless Odyssey

add



Best thing about this anime is Herlock himself. He is awesome and for the most part very relatable to me. I am the same kind of strong silent and willful type with Nordic temper/character. 

This show loves and worships Herlock so much that it even makes most other characters about twice as short compare to him. Miime and Key are the only crew members...

                              3D Kanojo is similar to Golden Time in regards to the concept of memory loss of the protagonist but instead of male, in this series female lead faces amnesia. In the end, both stories are quite good.

Suki tte Ii na yo.

add



As an avid fan of romantic anime, Suki tte Ii na yo quickly became one of my favorite series. I was immediately drawn in by the main character, Mei Tachibana, and her struggles to open up to others and trust after a traumatic childhood incident. Her journey towards self-discovery and learning to trust again was both relatable and inspiring.

The series...

Plastic Memories

add



""I hope that you will be reunited with the one that you cherish"" - Isla

Plastic memories tell a well-paced and subtle story with a great message. The world takes place with the idea of the Giftia, which is essentially an AI that isn't human but can mock human feelings. Isla is a Giftia and the journey that she takes throughout the series is one that...

Taishou Otome Otogibanashi

add



I'm not sure why the top featured review is a rant about female authors and calling this show an incel show but it's clearly just a romance anime. in short, nothing new or revolutionary. but it's also not the worst out there.

people aren't only liking this show because of who the author is. i have not read the manga and most of the time, i watch...

Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Outside Legend - The Endless Odyssey

add



Best thing about this anime is Herlock himself. He is awesome and for the most part very relatable to me. I am the same kind of strong silent and willful type with Nordic temper/character. 

This show loves and worships Herlock so much that it even makes most other characters about twice as short compare to him. Miime and Key are the only crew members...

3D Kanojo: Real Girl

                              3D Kanojo is similar to Golden Time in regards to the concept of memory loss of the protagonist but instead of male, in this series female lead faces amnesia. In the end, both stories are quite good.

 Vinland Saga Season 2


After his father's death and the destruction of his village at the hands of English raiders, Einar wishes for a peaceful life with his family on their newly rebuilt farms. However, fate has other plans: his village is invaded once again. Einar watches helplessly as the marauding Danes burn his lands and slaughter his family. The invaders capture Einar and take him back to Denmark as a slave. 

Einar clings to his mother's final words to survive. He is purchased by Ketil, a kind slave owner and landlord who promises that Einar can regain his freedom in return for working in the fields. Soon, Einar encounters his new partner in farm cultivation—Thorfinn, a dejected and melancholic slave. As Einar and Thorfinn work together toward their freedom, they are haunted by both sins of the past and the ploys of the present. Yet they carry on, grasping for a glimmer of hope, redemption, and peace in a world that is nothing but unjust and unforgiving.

In spite of his best time-leaping efforts, Takemichi Hanagaki continuously fails to prevent the present-day death of Hinata Tachibana, his adolescent love. The adult Takemichi grapples with grief and the ramifications of the Tokyo Manji gang's criminal empire—an unintended product of his timeline meddling. Though the gang once operated under the idealistic Manjirou ""Mikey"" Sano, it has now been taken over by the malicious Tetta Kisaki and, as a result, has abandoned its original optimistic intent.

Despite feeling hopeless, Takemichi travels to the past once again to investigate Black Dragon, a rival motorcycle gang whose actions ultimately lead to Hinata's demise. There, he meets the young Hakkai Shiba, a fellow gang member whose older brother, Taiju, tyrannically rules Black Dragon. When Taiju brutally beats Takemichi in a one-sided street brawl, Hakkai attempts to withdraw from Tokyo Manji in apology—an act that Takemichi must prevent to spare Hakkai a grim future.

Through a shared tragedy, Takemichi bonds with Chifuyu Matsuno, establishing a close comradery both boys desperately need. With Chifuyu on his side, Takemichi works to unravel the fates of Black Dragon's members, fighting to create a happy future for his loved ones.

Kind-hearted Himuro-kun is unfortunate: when in deep concentration, stressed, or flustered, he involuntarily creates blizzard conditions for himself and anyone in his vicinity. During one such incident on the first day of his new job, Himuro-kun encounters the beautiful Fuyutsuki-san, who helps him break out of his nerve-induced ice. As it turns out, Fuyutsuki-san is his new coworker.

At the office, the cool-headed Fuyutsuki-san offers simple and rational solutions to Himuro-kun's icy dilemmas—everything from helping him garden without freezing his plants to ensuring he does not melt during their tropical work retreat. Every time Fuyutsuki-san does something kind for him, the tempest of emotions he experiences inside embarrassingly manifests on the outside.

As a result of the frequent snowstorms, Himuro-kun's feelings for Fuyutsuki-san are impossible to hide. Even though Fuyutsuki-san is unfamiliar with love, Himuro-kun remains determined to repay her kindness and warm her heart in any way he can.

During a blizzard, Masayuki Muroi's old high school friend pushes him off a mountain to certain death. However, Masayuki survives the fall and escapes to safety thanks to Yuki-Onna, the spirit of a beautiful young woman who is said to lead men to their demise—but all she asks in return is money.

Eleven years later, Masayuki has lived a successful life, having gotten married and amassing a great fortune. But when his company collapses and his wife cheats on him, Masayuki retreats to the city where Yuki-Onna once saved him, and he reconnects with her by offering her money and tasty meals. While Masayuki recovers from his misfortunes, another one knocks on his door: his ex-wife is found beaten to death, and now only Yuki-Onna—who cannot reveal herself—can corroborate his alibi.

With no one to turn to, Yuki-Onna enlists the help of the spirits' God of Wisdom, Kotoko Iwanaga. Revered by the various spirits that wander the earth, Kotoko uses her extraordinary wits and cunning to solve all quarrels they may have. In her duty to protect spirits and humans from colliding, Kotoko drags along her immortal boyfriend, Kurou Sakuragawa, and promises to prove Masayuki's innocence without exposing Yuki-Onna's existence.

Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing ""magicology"" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth.

Due to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard. Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée. After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fiancée as a bully.

After crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing. She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to. Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllia's company.

As the night goes on, they take turns divulging their grievances and the hobbies they have taken up as a means of coping. While their stories are utterly different, there is one common thread: betrayal. Each of the four, having been bitterly betrayed by someone they treasured, has developed a deep-seated distrust of humanity.

But in addition to their similar worldviews, the four have one more commonality: a critical lack of funds. Realizing that things cannot continue as they are, they decide to form a party, rank up, and make as much money as possible to spend on their respective hobbies. What these disillusioned adventurers do not know, however, is that they will one day save the world from unfathomable peril.

But the man they find near the desolate town of Jeneora Rock is a far cry from the lethal terrorist they expect. In reality, Vash is a passive and carefree drifter; he is a proponent of peace, beloved by the residents of the town. His inaccurate reputation actually stems from the widespread atrocities committed by his twin brother Knives Millions. Still, Vash is dubbed ""The Humanoid Typhoon'' due to the tendency for violent chaos to follow in his wake.

Chaos soon arrives in the form of bounty hunters seeking the high price on Vash's head, and their violent pursuit poses great danger to the town and its precious power plant. Thanks to his gunslinging prowess, Vash is able to resist most of these nefarious forces. Yet he must soon face off against the ultimate evil: the unstoppable destructive power of his malevolent brother.

Haruyoshi is soon reborn in another world as Seika Lamprogue, an illegitimate son of a noble family that prides itself on magic.

The hero king Inglis—who dedicated his entire life to building his country—is now approaching death. To award him for his honorable achievements, the goddess Alistia appears and grants him one wish. Having never been able to master the blade, Inglis asks to be reincarnated in order to do so.

In a blink of an eye, Inglis finds himself born in the far future as a daughter of the Eucus noble family. Six years later, Inglis is discovered to be Runeless—incapable of utilizing the runes that enable the use of magic in this era. She is therefore ineligible to become a knight. However, this fits in well with Inglis' plan: she instead decides to become the squire for her cousin, Rafinha Bilford, allowing Inglis to focus on pushing her limits.

For Inglis, the challenges this familiar yet different world has to offer are instead opportunities for her to hone her skills—and possibly become an extraordinary squire in the process.

However, as Dariel lacks any magical potential, he is nothing but a disgrace in the eyes of Granverza's son, Bashubaza, who fires Dariel right after assuming his father's position as a general.

Stripped of a home and a job, Dariel wanders the forests, where he stumbles upon a human girl named Marika running from a monster. After Dariel intervenes to help Marika, she invites him to stay at her village in return. There, he discovers that the reason he has zero suitability for magic as a demon is that he is, in fact, a human.

However, Dariel is no ordinary human. Possessing potential that far outweighs even heroes, Dariel may soon find himself involved in the humans and demons' seemingly never-ending conflict, facing against the race he once considered allies.

The happy-go-lucky Michi Sonoda announces to her teammate, Sanae Takigawa, that she will quit judo for good after her final middle school tournament. This leaves Sanae in disbelief; after all, it was Michi's passion toward the sport that reeled Sanae into judo in the first place. Michi claims that a well-spent youth should be associated with things such as getting a boyfriend rather than sweaty tatami mats.

However, Michi's plan to end her fledgling judo career with a bang is spoiled after experiencing an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the talented Towa Hiura. Later, her plan is further derailed when she finds out that Towa has enrolled in the same high school as herself and Sanae. With the sudden appearance of her past foe, Michi may soon realize that she still has lingering feelings for the sport of judo.

Due to rising sea levels and a rapidly declining human population, androids have been engineered to perform most menial tasks, allowing humans to focus on other things. Aside from providing manual labor and customer service, androids also entertain humans through Babel—a tower where participants captivate audiences with song and dance to clear Climb Stages. The higher the climb, the more prize money is awarded.

Androids Cobalt, Chrom, Neon, and Kei are down on their luck and about to have their electricity cut off from unpaid bills. Desperate to make a quick buck, the group decide to become Babel climbers. However, winning the audience's favor is a great challenge. Dejected but unwilling to give up, Cobalt resolves to somehow improve their chances after watching an impressive performance by STAND-ALONE—the top climber unit.

When the group stumbles across a mysterious choreographer willing to give away his routine, Cobalt sees this as their only way up. With the help of their human companion, Esora Shibaura, the androids form the unit KNoCC to tackle the daunting climb to the top of Babel, but they must also overcome android-based discrimination along the way.

Gol D. Roger was known as the ""Pirate King,"" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.

Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

Yoichi Isagi was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would have sent his high school soccer team to the nationals, but a split-second decision to pass the ball to his teammate cost him that reality. Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. 

The project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.

For as long as he can remember, Minoru Kagenou has been fixated on becoming as strong as possible, which has led him to undertake all kinds of rigorous training. This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.

But instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world—one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker ""Shadow"" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.

When he finally regains consciousness, Ojisan begins to ramble in a foreign tongue and reveals that he had been transported to a magical world called Gran Bahamal. Takafumi dismisses his uncle's claims as nonsense until an incantation makes a cup of water hover in the air. In a flash of brilliance, the pair creates a YouTube channel to showcase Ojisan's magical abilities.

The responsibility now falls on Takafumi's shoulders to acquaint Ojisan with everything that has transpired during his absence, including getting him up to speed with the internet, new technology, and surprisingly, the outcome of the '90s console war—the result of which was especially distressing for a hardcore SEGA fan. With Ojisan's wisdom from his other world experiences, they grow their YouTube channel and tackle online comments and trolls. The journey of this uncle-nephew duo promises to be anything but conventional.

Saichi ""The Immortal"" Sugimoto and Asirpa can finally move forward together, but Asirpa's time with Kiroranke and Ogata Hyakunosuke has slightly altered her ambition and strengthened her determination. As their party leaves the Russian territory, they gain a peculiar follower.

Meanwhile, Toshizou Hijikata's crew makes major moves to get invaluable skins, falling into the poisonous trap of a dangerous convict. Although each group possesses a strong advantage over the others, even First Lieutenant Tokushirou Tsurumi—the most powerful and ruthless contender—cannot advance without Asirpa's help. However, his ominous plans for when they will inevitably meet remain a mystery.

The dawn of a decisive battle nears in Leyte Gulf against the Abyssal Fleet, the mysterious enemies that occupy the sea. As the only ones capable of fighting them, Kanmusu—young girls possessing the souls of warships—reorganize in preparation. The Shiratsuyu-class destroyer Shigure is assigned to the First Striking Force, Third Section—also known as 1YB3H.

Unfortunately for Shigure, 1YB3H consists of the remaining few Kanmusu and serves as a diversionary fleet. Needing to confront the Abyssal Fleet head-on, it may well be their first and final mission together. Even so, Shigure refuses to let the enemy take another comrade from her. As they advance toward Leyte Gulf during this suicidal mission, the members of 1YB3H must support each other and persevere to prove their worth as competent ships.

Digimon Ghost Game


Sightings of mysterious creatures known as ""Hologram Ghosts"" have been a popular topic on social networks for the past few years. According to the rumors, several people have fallen victim to these specters. Those fortunate to survive their encounters with the paranormal beings claim that they resembled glitched holograms.

Hazakura Academy middle school student Hiro Amanokawa believes these sightings are merely an urban legend. However, as the incidents start to increase in frequency, he is reminded of the day his father suddenly vanished, with strange digital watches serving as the only relics of his disappearance. Much like the other sightings, what happened to Hiro's father cannot be explained by conventional logic. 

One day, when a fellow student in the academy is attacked by a Hologram Ghost, Hiro and his friend Kiyoshirou Higashimitarai decide to look into the matter. Little does Hiro know that this investigation will be their first step toward discovering a dangerous world previously unknown to mankind.

IDOLiSH7 is more successful than ever, but no one is smiling because a new threat has taken the stage: the debuting idol group ŹOOĻ. Managed by the nefarious entertainment executive Ryou Tsukumo, they will stop at nothing to get their way, resorting to all kinds of underhanded tactics to bring down their rivals. TRIGGER's image has already been ruined by scandal, and IDOLiSH7 and Re:vale are headed for the same fate—or worse.

Meanwhile, Zero, the legendary idol who disappeared 15 years ago, continues to haunt the present through those he left behind. His manager seems to be in contact with Tsukumo for his own schemes, and Zero's songwriter reveals himself in a letter after having been missing for years. IDOLiSH7 finds an ally in Re:vale to thwart ŹOOĻ's plans while trying to make sense of Zero's colleagues' actions, but it may be impossible for everyone to emerge unscathed.

Sazae-san


The main character is a mother named Sazae-san. She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to ""The Partridge Family"" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like ""Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost"". Such ""boring"" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered ""acceptable"" by adults.

And so it was that the WNA succeeded in developing Ninja-Gum, an art which could summon forth the strength of the Shinobi. And yet creating the most powerful Ninja-Gum requires the strongest of ninja DNA. So it was that the Ninjala Tournament was held, that the mightiest of all ninjas could be found...

With a wicked scar on his face, a terrifying gaze, and an apron adorned with a teddy bear, ex-yakuza member Tatsu proudly assumes the role of a full-time househusband. Already familiar with the regular challenges of grocery shopping, Tatsu now takes it to the next level by joining a women's organization—but acceptance is not easily achieved without first mastering the elegance of flower arranging and housekeeping.

Approaching homemaking ventures through the lens of his former occupation, Tatsu faces haiku battles, typhoon alerts, and cosplaying villains. For his dearest wife Miku, Tatsu will do anything, even if he is interrupted by his old acquaintances, whose former vigor has also yet to subside. Never faltering before a new challenge, Tatsu's tranquil days as a househusband are proving to be just as hectic as before.

                Sequel to the original Tokyo Ghoul that takes the story from there.

Watch the original and read my review of that one before starting with this one. There will be spoilers to the original Tokyo Ghoul

If previous one was occasionally hard to watch, but somehow left a sense of hope for further development. It was clear that author did not intent to just leave it at just that and plans to take story into a new field. Just like slavery period for Captain Blood was but a prelude to his Pirate Captainship and audacious Pirate life, which what the story was really about. Kaneki going white
                  ...
haired almost felt like that moment when Blood and his crew finally captured Cinco Llagas. From there they defied both Spanish, British, French and rival pirates and became legendary pirate crew of the Caribbean, who pulled off shit, others could not even dream of. 

However Tokyo Ghoul does not take story into the same direction. Ultimately Kaneki did not become like Captain Blood. While early episodes of A Root still leaves room for that kind of development, later it clearly veers off that path. In fact if conclusion to the original leaves it open ended, conclusion to A Root kind of closes off these possibilities.

Fundamentally this show enjoys wallowing in guilt. Most characters suffer from guilt and even hurt themselves out of this feeling. As well as out their desire to be normal, to be human.

Most characters are driven towards protecting someone or preserving this pseudo normal 'human' lifestyle they have. What I have called Anteiku logic and principle in my review of the original. They are ghouls, but they want to be normal humans. So they do as much as they can to keep 'normal' human life.

Out of the characters only Ayato seemed fully embraced ghoul-ness and went of to create a world for ghouls by ghouls. I thought Aogiri was like that as well. To not spoil the A Root ending I would not tell much on how Aogiri really ended up.

Generally Ayato is probably the most relatable to me character in this story. Though by the end of A Root I am not sure really.

Ideology and values aside this show is not too bad. 

Battles are engaging, though they become repetitive close to the end of A Root, they are still fresh enough in the middle.

Plot does a good job engaging curiosity. You just want to know what will happen next and keep watching. 

Thus I can at least recommend watching it once. May be. It does leave a sense of disappointment at the end.

                ""I hope that you will be reunited with the one that you cherish"" - Isla

Plastic memories tell a well-paced and subtle story with a great message. The world takes place with the idea of the Giftia, which is essentially an AI that isn't human but can mock human feelings. Isla is a Giftia and the journey that she takes throughout the series is one that was very beautiful. The story is nothing too complex and the characters don't blow you out of the world, but the magic of the show is specifically between Tsukasa and Isla, and how their relationship evolves and changes over time,
                  ...
despite inevitable consequences. A recurring theme throughout the show is dealing with loss, and the topic is very beautifully handled. Oftentimes, Giftias are used as coping mechanisms for those who don't want to let go of the past and/or don't want to look into the future. In the process of retrieval, the owner must learn to cherish memories, accept reality, and part ways with something important to them in order to move on with their lives. Some episodes were boring but the buildup to multiple key events was masterfully paced and created full effect. No detail was meaningless and everything culminated nicely. The plot development wasn't really there but the presence of a central issue throughout all the episodes kept a sense of drama and urgency within the characters. The world-building was simply really well done and the outline for the show was well-organized even though it was clearly predictable after a few episodes which typically hinders the quality because, whats the point of watching if you already know what's going to happen, but that wasn't the case. A really beautiful romance, 9/10

                I'm not sure why the top featured review is a rant about female authors and calling this show an incel show but it's clearly just a romance anime. in short, nothing new or revolutionary. but it's also not the worst out there.

people aren't only liking this show because of who the author is. i have not read the manga and most of the time, i watch anime without even knowing who wrote it. that has nothing to do with it. but let's be real - if a man was the author of a manga with the premise of a young girl being sold as a
                  ...
bride to pay off debts, the content of the show would likely be a lot different. if we're generalising anyway, i'm sure you know what i mean. this anime is free of excessive fanservice and does not use overly-sexual humor as a crutch for romantic or sexual tension. 

the content of the show itself is very wholesome. the main character has no trace of incel behaviour whatsoever. we meet him when he is depressed after a devastating injury, and, having grown up in a loveless and cruel family, he is taught not to value his life. his father is ableist and writes his son off as a human simply due to his disability. while i've never experienced clinical depression, Tamahiko's thought process at the start of the show felt like a very realistic portrayal of someone feeling despair. 

with the introduction of Yuzuki into his life, Tamahoko experiences a kindness he's never known before. he learns to think of someone other than himself and finds happiness and self-assurance through the power of love and friendship. it wasn't that he was selfish before he met Yuzuki, as we see him give her his robe and tell her not to catch a cold as soon as she steps through his front door. rather, the family he was raised in extended no kindness or compassion to him, so internally he felt he was all alone and had to fend for himself. by the end of the show, we get to see him transformed into quite a selfless and generous person who helps those in need freely, even if they were rude to him in the past. 

sure, you can say the extreme-optimism of Yuzuki is an overused trope and is unrealistic, but the show isn't necessarily going for realistic but rather wholesome. it's fiction anyway so i don't see the problem with it. people often look for escapism in fiction, and romance isn't always about realism but about the characters and their story. which in this case was a nice one. i love it when we get to see a character evolve throughout the show and we definitely see that in Tamahiko. 

honestly if you are looking for a 12 episode romance, and are tired of all the fanservice-laden shounen ones, i think this one is a good fit. despite it centering Tamahiko over Yuzuki, i found it to be cute and wholesome and rather charming. i also enjoyed the 20s historical set, with glances of 1920s western fashion among the traditional Japanese kimono in some of the Tokyo crowds.

the opening and ending theme songs aren't great but they aren't the worst. the soundtrack is nice and soothing and fits the scenes very well. i actually wish the songs within the episodes were used as the op and ed instead haha, they are very nice songs and the lyrics were meaningful to the characters and their internal experiences. the rest of the cast are fleshed out nicely and added to the plot as well. 

the animation is fine - not crazy amazing but not bad at all. it's not super stiff or anything and the color palette is cohesive and nice to look at. the character design is also fine.

Space Pirate Captain Herlock: Outside Legend - The Endless Odyssey

                Best thing about this anime is Herlock himself. He is awesome and for the most part very relatable to me. I am the same kind of strong silent and willful type with Nordic temper/character. 

This show loves and worships Herlock so much that it even makes most other characters about twice as short compare to him. Miime and Key are the only crew members of roughly the same size. 

So if you like Herlock you will enjoy this show overall. If not then you probably won't.

Herlock is independent and unconventional hero who does what he wants and rejects all duty and obligations. He achieves great
                  ...
things despite that.

This time around story is actually rather psychological and philosophical even. This installment of Herlock saga tries to be as deep and profound as Revolutionary Girl Utena, SEL or Umineko. It even has some of the SEL vibe to it. 

Being deep and profound kind of works half of the time. Some good ideas are often mixed with some cliches of living like 'real men' and such. It is somewhat intellectually stimulating nevertheless. I would say it begins and ends rather poorly, but middle part is rather good.

Art quality overall is rather good for 2002. However the show deliberately imitates old style art of the original Herlock of 1978, so many characters are in that deliberately retro style.

Overall I can recommend this for everyone. It is probably more accessible for a modern anime fan than old original Herlock and also much shorter than it. It can nevertheless introduce you to this legendary Space Captain, one of the best anime characters of all time.

                ....hmm. That's the only word that comes to mind after watching this movie. Whereas I was starstruck about the previous movie and second and third season's animation-- this movie left me with an overwhelming sense of nothing. Neither negative or positive. In the words of my brother-- it was a great ad, but to be honest.. questionable if it needed a movie.
If you haven't gotten the gist from the summary or online critics - it's a super-ultra condensed summary episode + the beginning of the new season that airs next month. Now I usually will watch and enjoy remastered anime / director's cut / summary
                  ...
episodes-- but this wasn't really worth the ticket, truthfully. HOWEVER:

You should watch it if:
- You started season 3 and put it on hold because it's been FIVE THOUSAND YEARS and Tanjiro is alive somehow when he should have stopped breathing five deadly injuries ago.
- You didn't watch season 3 at all and don't want to watch the AMAZING fight scenes, but would like to know what happened.
- You have put down the Demon Slayer for a while and forgot most of what happened.
- You simply love Demon Slayer animation/seiyuus/music.
- You are trying to catch a casual/non-anime fan up to the franchise without giving them a four hour play-by-play of each previous episode. (We had a friend with us who was in this category. They said they had a pretty broad/good idea on the direction of the plot after watching this--- and seemed intrigued to visit the manga following the showing despite also having a lukewarm reaction to the concept overall.)
- You don't mind watching literally a copy and paste of previous seasons (i.e. virtually no cuts where episode 10 starts)

Why this is not recommended:
Honestly, maybe the bar is set too high for the franchise. Maybe it's the mainstream fatigue. I'm not sure. Generally speaking the movie was not bad as it had stunning long shots of many backdrops we previously glossed over through the fight scene. That said, my two major gripes were that first off, while there were glamour shots (that you can tell took a ton of time and diligence) -- there were SO many scenes where they would pan over the same 3 second animation like three or four times. It's pretty but almost seems like a YouTube AMV with old clips (which is ironic because these are angles that weren't from the previous seasons); it's not similar shots, it's just the same clip used to supplement space to break subtitles apart so you don't have a character's speech take up the whole screen.
To follow up on that, for some reason they would replay the clip highlight from 3 minutes ago AGAIN.. and had mid-credit credits. I get the point normally; if this was aired online this style would make sense. Episode 10 start to finish. Episode 11 starts with a few minutes of recap, then the episode starts. But instead it would play the last 5-6 minutes of the last episode with no type of jump cuts; it makes literally no sense why they didn't put in any transitions considering there was no ad break or real life intermission. It didn't even need to be a fancy edit--they could have just cut those REUSED scenes as nothing changed. These recap scenes were all from the previous season so essentially if you watched all the content chronologically you literally copy and pasted-watched the same scene three times. 

Overall rating:
The animation was very ufotable. Beautiful and almost greenscreen/lifelike. I feel like even real fire doesn't compare to how real one of the fire scenes looked. It was definitely CGI without ""looking like CGI"" if that makes sense.

But as a movie--and especially a recap movie-- there was absolutely NO directing added in post production. We have a theory that due to COVID (among other factors), staff were overall dissatisfied with the pacing of the second half of last season so they straight up redid it. Which had an added bonus to be a cliff-notes for anyone (which would be an added bonus due to the explosion of the franchise in the west). That's the only justification I can surmise.

That said, all that hard work was almost immediately nullified for having the episodes get attached back to back with repeated scenes. It was a fine (6) summary that should really be rated a 4 because it felt like they were trying to reach the minimum required words in an essay,. One repeat. it's fine. Two it's annoying, but acceptable (even though it shouldn't be knowing the money that this series raked in). After that, there's no excuse. Even 4 seems too high by MALs rating system, but alas. There was hard work put into this movie. Maybe when it reached the online audience, it'll be considerably more enjoyable because one can just fast forward what was already a skimming of the previous few seasons. But after the 45 minute mark I was checking the time every 10 minutes because it was just.... nothing new or different or interesting.

Honestly, even the new episode made me question if I had already watched this somewhere (although presumably the deja vu was because it was adapted almost to the tee as the pacing was EXACTLY as slow).

Maybe if I had stopped around episode 7 or 8 in the third season, and then transitioned to this movie this would be rated higher (...an 8...or 7 maybe?) But at the moment, I can't begin to guesstimate that feeling as I'm still frustrated at how it felt like I wasted my time-- yet I didn't want to walk out of the theater since the US barely gets enough anime movies anyways. But it was a miss. We were one of two parties in the entire theater and it was the first day of showing so... yeah.

                Kekkai Sensen is a one-of-a-kind anime that combines action, comedy, and supernatural elements in an entertaining and captivating way. The show follows Leonardo Watch, a young photographer who gains the ""All-Seeing Eyes of the Gods"" and becomes involved with the secret organisation Libra, which is tasked with protecting Hellsalem's Lot from supernatural threats.

Kekkai Sensen's animation is stunning, with vibrant colours and detailed backgrounds that bring the city to life. The action scenes are also well choreographed and exciting to watch, with a diverse cast of characters battling supernatural foes with their unique abilities.

Kekkai Sensen's comedy is another strong suit, with plenty of witty one-liners and
                  ...
amusing moments peppered throughout the show. The characters are all well-developed and likeable, with distinct quirks and personalities that set them apart.

Overall, Kekkai Sensen is a fun and well-executed anime that is well worth watching. While the plot can be a little confusing at times and the pacing can be a little slow in some episodes, the show's strong characters, stunning animation, and unique blend of genres make it a standout series. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting and entertaining anime experience.

                A definite hit or miss, Eminence in Shadow will either be one of the most entertaining, humorous, and overall fun watches you have ever seen or an anime that you find disorganized, annoying, and unstructured. 

The overall story is not the most followable, with a good amount of random twists and turns and plot holes, but I personally am not approaching an anime to analyze its emotional investment into its characters and plot, I'm there to have fun. At a certain point in anime, there is a expected dialogue, or event, that establishes the characters as lovable or presents the ""heartwrenching moment"" in key moments
                  ...
to make you feel connections towards the character, the Eminence in Shadow does not have this.

What it does have though, is good audio, good animation, and overall an entertaining watch that grows if you come to not think about the plots reasoning (its an isekai for goodness sakes) and more just try to watch a fun quip of a show.

Overall its an easy recommend, while its not close to as revolutionary as other animes that will be known for a long time for their story development, characters etc, it is definitely a watch if you're bored and just want some entertainment.

The story is about a God of Misfortune that comes to earth in order to get a fortune from a girl that is unusually high. But it is not easy for Her to get the fortune, She must face a lot of obstacles. Then they become a rival and a lot of comedy scenes occurred since they are very different like yin and yang.

Art (9)

using for this anime.

Sound (9)
All the sounds they used are very good and adjusted to the animation.

Character (10)
The main character is very memorable for the main and supporter characters. They really have unique personalities.

It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023. There are a lot of comedy scenes in this anime.

Overall (9)
Recommended for those who love comedy and action!

Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu

                Note: 
Mushoku Tensei season 1 part 1 = LN Vol 1-3
Mushoku Tensei season 1 part 2 = LN Vol 4-6

1. World Building
2. Character’s life
3. Story

1. World Building
Mushoku Tensei is an excellent isekai anime. We always refer to Isekai as another world that is typically a fantasy world of Sword and Sorcery. However, most isekai anime tend to create a world with Japanese RPG-style elements and a lot of game designs. On the other hand, ""Mushoku Tensei"" focuses on creating the epic fantasy world of Sword and Sorcery. This world has its own history, culture, myths, beliefs, languages, geography, etc.
Have you known the theory of Flat
                  ...
Earth? In LN Vol 2, Six-Faced World is a world in hexahedral form where all beings live on its planes. It exists in a die-shaped structure with a total of six faces, each face is constituted of one world ruled by one God each, with another seventh world of nothingness inside the die-structure. Each face is flat and separated by barrier.
In the history, Human and Demon had started 3 Great Human-Demon War in total. But anime didn't describe these interesting setting and story.


2. Character’s life
'Each person is an individual' and 'Everyone has their own life. are the subject of Mushoku Tensei. The characters are like a real person you met in reality. They have their own logic, ideas, experiences and perspectives. The main character’s understandings or thoughts are often different from those of the other characters. This is why the MC has misunderstandings, conflicts and even fights with them. Besides, wifu characters and even side characters have their own life. They are not a tool for serving MC and the story. They have their own goals in life, so they will decide for themselves how to live their lives.
Unlike some stories, these characters are only there to highlight the power of the main character, who decides the direction of their lives.
For example, Roxy can't cast magic without chanting, but her student can. It hurts her self-esteem. That's why she wanted to leave Rudy and decided to continue her studies in magic. If this was a normal isekai, maybe it would be about her getting stronger with the MC.
Characters have both advantages and disadvantages. No one is perfect. For example, Paul is a play boy. That’s why he cheated on his wife, Zenith. However, if Paul is just a bastard, he wouldn’t have had to take the responsibility for finding his family after the mana disaster happened.
Some reviews always focus on Rudy’s Pedophilia. As a LN reader, I don't think Rudy is a pedophile because he has not shown any sexual desire for minors since he became an adult. (It will show the detail in season 2.)
Adulthood in this world is 15, after all it is an old world where there is no compulsory education and no concept of child labor, which is why Rudy was introduced to tutoring for money by his father at such an early age.
Rudy was also a minor in the season 1. Perhaps his mental age is 34, but his body has been reborn. Remember what he said in the episode 1? He said, ""Maybe because she's my mother, I don't have any sexual desire for her.” This body affects the senses of his brain. This’s why he interacted with girls of his own age.
Except for Eris, you could find that Rudy has a degree of respect for other female (The worst behavior is peeking or stare. Yeah, we should agree that Rudy is a dirty lech.) If he really wanted to touch their bodies, he would ask their will. For example, Rudy asked to see Ghislaine's tail and touch her ass.
If you ask me why Rudy didn’t respect Eris at the beginning, it's because Eris was a spoiled brat. The willful, arrogant and violent young lady beat up Rudy every day. This made it difficult for Rudy to treat Eris like any other female. But Eris is the boss's daughter and has a strong vengeful streak, which made it impossible for Rudy to confront her. Don't forget that Rudy was actually physically smaller than Eris. This is why Rudy chose to paw Eris while she was sleeping to assuage Rudy's usual grievances.

3. Story
I listened some podcasts talking about Mushoku Tensei. One podcaster said, “You will feel very comfortable when you watch this story. For example, when we watched the beast person at the beginning, it didn’t immediately introduce her background. We only got to know her personality, but then we started in an unexpected adventure to her homeland. We learned that the woman we know was once spurned by her homeland and her family. But when her brother heard about her current situation, he realized how much he regretted it. The story also shows that people can change. It is such a simple and comfortable way to be part of a world that has so many surprises waiting to be discovered, such as when the castle in the sky is going to be available! It reminds me of the spirit I had when I was young and wanted to go on adventures everywhere.”
A good story can inspire people to express their thoughts.

                All the babes in this anime already have boyfriends!
I can see how some people might be into Yase, but she has mommy issues, and is part demon so I would advise against asking her out if you value your life.
That pretty much leaves Shouko as most eligible bachelorette. Shouko’s dedication to her work may make her seem unapproachable, but I’d be willing to bet she’d be willing to go out with just about anyone if they could keep those kids out of her hair for a day. So there’s your in.
Kyousou Giga feels like a lot of care was put into making every aspect of
                  ...
it. I wanted to like it more than I did, but had a hard time motivating myself to watch it.
Found myself struggling to understand what I would later come to realize was a thin, relatively easy to understand plot that only seemed complicated because of the storytelling style

The characters are all painfully cliche and the most trope covered thing in both anime/tv shows in general thats I've personally ever seen and I say this seeing a little bit of Darling plus HSotD. At least those scenarios were sort of funny you could laugh at. This is basically that one kid who

I'm personally hoping the manga isn't nearly as bad as the anime adaptation but dear god is this bad.

                Summertime Render is one of the best anime in recent years, period. Let me just start with that. It's freakin' great!

But let's break it down further:

Animation / Art / General Visuals - 10/10
-----------------------------------------------

An absolute masterpiece. The visuals simply blew me the hell away, and I'm hundreds of anime deep. The scenery is gorgeous. The entire setting is as if painted by masters with unlimited time. I can't even imagine improving on this.

The animation is similarly top notch, with faces receiving amazing detail when it comes to emoting. Extreme versions of both realistic and comedic variations are masterfully sprinkled into the show. Just enough to catch
                  ...
you completely off guard but not enough to go overboard. Absolutely incredible.

This visuals alone would be enough to recommend this show to most anime fans. THIS IS what he format excels at. You can't get this from any manga or light novel. It's that beautiful.

Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 9/10
------------------------------------------

Masterful. Sounds fit the scenery perfectly. Every detail whether in the background or foreground has the right sounds that really hit the spot.

The OP's are cool, and the ED's very nice as well.

I must say that I didn't notice any particularly memorable tracks during the show, so that's my only subjective complaint. But that shouldn't matter to most of you reading this, as your music tastes may be completely different.

Voice acting is good across the board. More than good in many places. All the characters have appropriate voices and many of them are put through a wide range of emotions which are excellently portrayed. It's hard to find anything to complain about.

Story - 9/10
-------------

Summertime Render is a story that starts with the premise of a murder mystery. Which is the genre I was expecting when I went into this.
However, that premise quickly evolves into a supernatural horror mystery, before evolving(or devolving?) into a more standard Shounen-esque style for the second half, leaning more heavily into Time Travel and Supernatural Combat. Splash of Romance is thrown into the mix, but not in an overbearing kind of way. It's done in a way that makes you more invested without hogging the focus from the other aspects.

The story ended up being rather unpredictable which is a pretty good sign for any show that aims to have mystery. Though I'm sure some viewers will be angry at the original premise not being sustained quite all the way through.

The overarching story and execution can't claim to be fully original, leaning on and borrowing aspects of many great shows that have come before, but it manages to put unique twists on most things, leading to a very satisfying, and fresh experience. It's really hard to complain when you get more of the good thing. Using storytelling tactics that have been used before is no crime, especially if the original is near perfect and so is the follow-up. And this is about as close to perfect as you're likely to get.

Truly, an enjoyable experience all the way through.

Characters - 9/10
---------------------

Ajiro Shinpei, the main character is quite interesting and enjoyable to watch. Unlike the hordes of incompetent and dumb MC's that we're pestered with in most anime, Shinpei is very capable. He doesn't quite reach the level of being ""OP"" or an obvious genius or martial arts expert or anything like that, but he's a solid notch above your everyday MC. He thinks fast on his feet, is capable of long term planning, isn't crippled by his emotions at every turn, and even handles romance as a normal teenager - that is, the anime tropes of a completely oblivious and romantically incapable MC do not hold true here. There's some of it, but it stays within the reason of teenage romance.

Supporting cast is similarly pleasing. With many characters being stand-out in their personalities, especially the MC's core partners with whom he spends most of his time with. They all have very distinct personalities that play off of each other real well. 

One might complain a little that we don't get quite as much depth on some of them to truly flesh them out, not even the MC gets as much backstory as we'd like - but still, they feel like actual human beings in this story, and not just some random placeholders whose job is to spout exposition and get involved in lame anime tropes. No, the characters make sense as they are, doing what they're doing. And that's pleasing.

The villains are similarly interesting and you'll have a good time trying to get a handle on what they're all about, and the show certainly isn't holding our hand when it comes to figuring it out. Tensions run high the entire show, and full understanding and catharsis is properly left to the very end.

---

Total - 9/10

---

One of the most enjoyable anime I've had the pleasure of ever watching. Amazing production values, great story, great characters. Can't really ask for more than that. And best of all? The story is finished. You're not getting blue balled. You get all 25 episodes, a full start to finish injection right into your veins. Cherish it, as it's becoming more and more rare in the anime world these days.

                My first exposure to The Eminence in Shadow was my friend on Discord singing praises for the anime. He told me it was a parody show that took all these tired isekai cliches and turned them on their head, much like Overlord. And he was right; The Eminence in Shadow is much like Overlord in that they both use the illusion of satire to deliver the same regurgitated stories and character archetypes as the genre they claim to parody, played completely straight with only the slightest modicum of irony to keep the veil from dropping. At first glance, you wouldn’t even be able to tell
                  ...
this is a parody. I struggled to sit through 4 episodes, and dropped it when I realized it was exactly as I’d feared; mediocre isekai nonsense putting on the pretense of being something greater to sell merchandise of the cast of nondescript archetypal anime girls. Only months later, after copious debates with my Discord friends and after several drinks was I able to finish the proceeding 16 episodes, all the while baffled by what I thought at the time was the sheer incompetence of the directing and adaptation of mediocre genre fare. But upon looking into the manga and LNs, I can confidently proclaim that Eminence in Shadow (the anime) is one of the most subversive, avant-garde comedy anime of all time. It’s so dedicated to making every single joke, every mildly humorous moment from the original works so profoundly atrocious and lacking in impact that it circles back around and reaches its intention: being the world’s greatest anti-comedy.

I’m going to get this out of the way quickly and say that, despite my earlier claim, the original manga and LNs (or whichever comes first) for this series aren’t masterpieces. The writing and dialogue are stiff and awkward, the story hinges on contrivance, half the cast is sorely lacking anything to distinguish one another, and there’s copious amounts of “ironic edge” that would make an r/nihilism user blush. But I’ll give it exemplary praise in that it’s actually genuinely funny at times, something so rare for the majority of media like this that I was caught off guard at first. Cid Kagenou is truly hilarious whenever he goes into one of his absurd Machiavellian rants in his head as he details his complex blueprints for putting on the front a boring, cringey man. He seems like the natural conclusion of Lelouch from Code Geass (or Light from Death Note if you’d prefer I cited an actually good character), taken to an illogical extreme. He’s the kinda guy who would nail himself to a cross to get stronger (he actually does this in one of the novels!). He truck’d himself for the specific purpose of being isekai’d. Scenes like where he asks a girl out in the most humiliating way possible are just so expertly compounded by him narrating every single action and decision in his head, such as calculating the perfect trajectory to bow down like a pathetic spastic. Here, every chuuni delusion is spelled out, making him look simultaneously awe-inspiring yet totally corny. He takes everything in stride; playing a pussywhipped slave is all part of his self-proclaimed master plan to rule the world in secrecy. Even when he’s surprised at how accurate his random guesses are, he just rolls with it. As much of a copout as it is, I think it’s a really great bit that keeps the story moving without getting too predictable. We even get to see inside the heads of other characters as they try to process the shitstorm of absurdity unfolding in front of them.

Now try to imagine an adaptation that completely cuts out the vast majority of Cid and the rests’ monologues, shoots down the jokes in midair so they just fall flat, and throws the tone of the series into disarray, killing any and all nuance the source material had going for it. Even disregarding the lack of first-person mental POVs for the most part, the comedic timing and execution is awful. The anime can’t seem to decide how it wants to portray Cid, choosing to take him 100% seriously the vast majority of the time. This distortion of the manga’s comedic nature to justify going all-in on the embarrassing power fantasies seems almost purposeful, and I’m not cynical enough to consider it a case of full-on directorial incompetence, nor a case of misplaced hubris like MAPPA’s Chainsaw Man adaptation; despite this being his first true directing gig, Kazuya Nakanishi has a good 20 years of experience working mostly assistant director and animation director positions on a number of well-received titles. I’m not sure how likely it was that everyone involved with production completely misunderstood the nature of the series, so I’m guessing they decided to change it to appeal to more casual viewers. It’s like the inverse of the manga, where there was some self-awareness around how much of an admirable dweeb Cid actually was behind all the posturing; the exaggerated art hammered the point home and made it so the tone was never too self-serious. He’s supposed to be cool because his ridiculous larp always ends in success, not because his ridiculous larp looks cool in-universe. The anime just asks you to take everything at face value, or at least seems to because the way they handle comedy in the anime is frustrating. 

Everything in the anime is taken dead serious, failing to preserve the ever-present irony of the source material. It’s a dreary, obtuse mess where every scene plays out about as lifelessly as a bad Shakespeare adaptation; try to count the number of times there’s an expository scene that’s just shot reverse shot of characters talking with uninterested faces as nothing else happens for 3 to 4 minutes. Sometimes it happens multiple times per episode. Even worse, every time they try and go ahead with landing a punchline it derails the tone of the scene. Even a modicum of comedy feels out of place in an adaptation this dull. It’s like Fullmetal Alchemist 03 took SSRIs. But for all that show’s failings, it had competent directors, writers and production staff to turn it into something worthwhile, all of which Eminence in Shadow does not. Whoever was planning the anime out has no idea what makes the original material funny or engaging. Instead of embracing the inherent silliness, the anime only retains the worst of Eminence’s “humor”; repetitive gags that wouldn’t impress a middle schooler. You can almost spot the gaps in dialogue where they could’ve added canned laugh tracks after every joke. A character’s name being “Perverted Asshat” and it being thrown around ad nauseum is one of the least terrible examples might give you insight into how dire the material you’re dealing with can get.

And that’s not even getting into the problems I have with the source material itself. Firstly, Cid’s character makes no sense when you look into his motivations; his goal is to become both a background character AND the man behind everything, yet every action he takes as a civilian is contradictory. He’s always interacting with the most important people around him, getting into fights he easily wins with his superior magical powers, and finding himself involved in every conspiracy. Most of the time he isn’t even pretending to be Shadow while doing all this. Am I missing something? It feels like the writer just wanted an excuse for Cid to dick around in at magic highschool and somehow couldn’t find enough of a reason to have him do his supervillain shtick while he was actually in-character. What’s the point in immediately render your main character’s goal meaningless? It’s not like they wanted to dedicate any time to developing other characters, because as many as there are, they’re shallow as a puddle.

As much as Eminence can satirize edgy self-insert MCs, the series hardly has any faith in its characters and reduces them to boring, derivative models taken from every other low-effort power fantasy that came before it. Every female character has the same face. I can’t even remember half their names outside of Delta, who looks like Blake from RWBY, which is somehow a more watchable show than this. At least I can name most of RWBY’s cast and describe their personalities. Seriously every new female character in Eminence feels like they were produced in a factory that makes anime girls who are so hard-tailored to be appealing to lonely, bitter people like me it actually feels patronizing. The worst part is that they all look so similar that they blend together after the first 5 episodes. I started getting confused as to who was talking to who in some scenes because even their voices have very little differentiation. I don’t have any problem with conventional characters insofar as they possess interesting attributes; I couldn’t even begin to describe what makes any of these copy-paste bitches so special. That won’t stop people from spending thousands a month trying to summon them in all their fanservice uniforms on the shitty Eminence gacha game Crunchyroll was promoting (even though they don’t own the streaming rights to the anime???). The other side characters are equally dismal. If you skipped all the scenes of Cid’s classmates at the dumb Light Novel magic school talking about inane plot developments or fucking about you’d be skipping more filler than the average Shippuden arc. I know most of these season isekai shows spend an exorbitant amount of screentime on side characters jabbering on about dumb bullshit but it feels particularly egregious here, in a show where none of them serve any purpose aside from that. I’d be really impressed if you could find somebody who genuinely cares about these losers.

Eminence isn’t all contrivances and pretensions. As boring as the direction is in conversational scenes, it’s got enough flashy fight sakuga to distance itself from the dozens of far worse isekai that came out around the sam. Episodes 5 and 20 are the standout, where the direction and animation quality actually take a massive step up for a few minutes during said episodes’ central fights (I AM ATOMIC is way too cool a moment for this series). Kenichiro Suehiro (the RE:Zero guy)’s soundtrack is the hypest shit you’ll ever hear. As much as I want to scrutinize every aspect of this series out of spite, there’s some genuine passion put into it. I can be a sore loser and say “I wish Hoshi no Samidare got that same treatment!” but that wouldn’t solve anything. As a whole The Eminence in Shadow is just so sincerely unimpressive that it makes me wonder what anyone sees in it; of course I already know what they see in it, cool fights, self-insert protagonists and women who show affection, but it makes me wonder why nobody wants anything else. The isekai/”literally me!” genre dissolved into a homogenous mess of repetition somewhere around 2016 or 2017 and the anime community hardly seems to care. But the amount of fans acting like Eminence is really that much of a breath of fresh air just goes to show that deep down, people are growing weary of the formula and any surface-level deviation from the norm is cause for consideration. I can see it. I understand. It’s still bad, but I’d be lying if I said it’s less more inviting than “I Got Reincarnated as Chad and Girls Pay Attention to Me Now” or Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 9 out of 20.

                Overall this show gets pretty good towards the end and it was worth watching. However at the start the show tried to be too realistic,which made it unrealistic. I find it hard to believe that after basic training,6 of them would struggle against 1 goblin,even in hard video games like sekiro,it is quite easy to kill 1 npc after playing the tutorial. The characters in this show are pretty decent and showed good development throughout.

Pros:
Art style looks nice
Fight scenes are well animated
Good soundtrack
Most characters are well developed for a 12ep anime

Cons
As mentioned above the first few fights were unrealistic
Some parts felt rushed which diminished the
                  ...
emotional payoff(understandable for a 12ep anime)

This can be a pro or a con depending on the way you look at it ,but i felt that they should have explained why they are trapped in this world or at least hint at a reason towards the end. I can however see why they would do that as this mystery sets up the LNs which i have yet to read.

All in all,this show was really enjoyable towards the end as i felt that the fights were a lot more realistic and exciting,the last few episodes also adds a lot more depth to the characters relationship with each other and developed their characters well. 
Gave it a 7/10 due to the bad start and because i felt that this anime does not really have anything that makes it stand out besides the fact that it is more realistic than other shows.

                This special anime episode is so goood! I am glad they took their time to create this masterpiece. The pacing, music, ambience, and action are done really well. I'm glad that I never read the mange so when I watched it, I am surprised for the first time. Of course many people are saying that the ending is not good, but so far at least until the season 4 part 3 I feel like it's still a masterpiece so I'm not sure where it would go down from here.. like how would you mess up lol. Hence I'm still having a hope that they are
                  ...
going to end the series well and cement AOT to be one of the best anime of all time (if not the best).

I hope on the last special episode they can make it a 2hours+ movie instead (maybe combine with the part 1). So we can really ends this series masterpiece on a large screen!

                So I gave this a 7/10 review... Also this review is for the DUB version. Please note, many of us are dyslexic, can have issues reading sub while trying to appreciate the art of the shows.  

So, Sadly I had to downgraded it by 2 points.  This would be due the absolute dismal voice acting, I had flashbacks of most the Netflix Dubs.  Brittany is a S Tier VA, so what happened here.  She was almost nauseating to listen to. Her gasping for air every time she spoke drove me nuts. Momo was a really good character, and if not for
                  ...
her compulsive stalker mentality, easy would have been a fan favorite.

So, how did I even give it 7 stars... STORY STROY STORY.  Very well done and creative story and I would love to see the direction we are heading.  I encourage you to watch this, sub if you can, dub if like me you must.

There are other reviews that are very off base of why this anime is not more popular.  Simply put, Hidive is a terrible platform. I join for 1 month ever 2-3 years, Catch up on Dubs and move on.  Their Dubs are often poorly directed and converted.

                I have never written a review and I will probably never write another review besides the second season and hopefully the third season.

Magical slapstick buddy comedy with a fun cast of cute girls. Wonderful friendship for two people that got a bad hand in life but keep looking forward.

Art style wasn’t revolutionary, but the colorful palette and the efficient use of high-paced stills and cuteness makes it more than satisfactory

Last comment funniest all-female cast since I watched Nichijou

If you’re looking for this anime to do anything more than make you laugh and love the characters, then don’t bother. THIS ANIME IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR PEOPLE
                  ...
WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR.

                Overall, I personally enjoyed the movie. It was beautiful. The OST was great. The character development was fantastic. I have no complaints on either of those. My complaints lie with the ending. Everything was going great. The princess and the pilot had a really sweet bond going on and a unique adventure, but the end..... the gosh darn end. It truly had so much potential at the end and that potential just wasn't used. Not only did it feel unfinished, but the unsatisfaction was really there. What the audience wanted, the audience didn't get. 

Nonetheless, I can't cut out that the rest of the story
                  ...
was definitely an amazing adventure between this princess and this pilot. It still didn't ruin the anime and even though things felt improper to end it the way it did, it shouldn't take out the enjoyment of the entire journey that these two characters had.

solid 8/10

                If anyone would told me that this anime would have be one of my favorites of the season, I would have laughed at them.  I had it on the list to check but every time I would open it early on to watch I would just close it and say ""I'm just not feeling it.""  Finally got around to sitting down to watch it and next thing you know I was at episode 8.

Characters:  Every single character has their own uniqueness to them.  Each of the characters play well off each other, even their opponents just mix in well with the others making it fun to watch them struggle and overcome their shortcomings.  

Sound:  The music really adds to this series I feel.  The upbeat tracks when things are going well to the more muted but hopeful tracks when characters find a goal they want to aim for.  It really adds to the emotions these girls are feeling in those moments.

As a sports anime its very grounded in the fact that it's not a shonen style series like Blue Lock or Haikyuu so you won't get those over the top moves.  

Take it from someone who almost didn't watch it, give this a shot it's well worth your time.

                                      (9/12 eps)
                                   





                As a matter of fact, I have watched all 12 episodes of Mono-NO-gatari (because I'm doing the subtitles for this anime). Please don't get confused with the Monogatari series. Anyway, I don't like complicating things. At the end of the day, reviews are still one's own thought and the simple me is saying Mononogatari is worth watching. So I'll keep this review short.

According to some harsh critics, this anime is quite typical. I guess I can see why is that. MC with typical traumatic past that it shapes him growing to become a person full of loath, and that hatred is towards tsukumogami—a type of
                  ...
spirits. However, from the way the story is told and the way the dialogue is spoken, this anime somehow directs you away from seeing it as ""typical"" sometimes. In fact, the storytelling and the vibe it's giving are BE-AU-TI-FUL. They are not the only reason why I keep watching but they can be one of the reasons why you're able to proceed. There's just something about Mononogatari that can keep you engrossed the more you watch, and the relationships can get you intrigued. Mononogatari focused more on how the MC's perspective is changing and how the trust is built (with a bit of romance sprinkled). Of course, actions are also included.

Heads-up, you might be not fond of the MC from the beginning for his attitude. Know that he's just an awkward person and sterns with himself. It's the very reason why he was sent to Nagatsuki Botan's house, a girl that is on good terms with some tsukumogami, to change his attitude in which he always resort to force towards tsukumogami. HE IS changing for the better though so hope you don't keep the hate for him too long (only if you do). And he admits to his own mistakes.

I see the other review mentions about chibi animation for comedic relief. They are very small amount in the beginning and the chibi keeps to only the face become a bit child-like with the adult body intact later in the show so the ""chibis"" can actually go unnoticed. I'm not sure about bad English translations. Maybe you guys can try watching on bilibili instead, an official platform but free to watch. ""Malevolent Spirits: Mononogatari"" is labelled ""Premium"" (the official one) so you have to wait every week to get free access to later released episode.

Maybe I am being lenient but it's not in the least boring to me. And I'm not kidding when I say it has beautiful storytelling, along with the BGM. I'm dreading to listen to that beautiful OST full version if there's any. Hence, I am questioning the average rating under 7.00 tbh. Mononogatari is really good and it is an 8/10 for me. Not more, but definitely not less.

                You know, Comic Artist and His Assistants was so close to being a recommended anime for me. It's both funny in sad in its all too real portrayal of the modern Japanese man; awkward, anti-social, unable to properly talk to women or distinguish fantasy from reality. it could have worked as either a lampooning of the ecchi genre or just straight up ecchi with social commentary and I would have lauded it as one of the more standout horny comedies. It was so close. But the problem is it wants to sexualize women who look prepubescent in the creepiest possible manner. It's one thing to
                  ...
take an adult woman who is five-foot-nothing and lacks large... tracts of land, and sexualize her. It's not unheard of in real life and women like this deserve a chance to be represented in adult media. It's another thing to put said woman in little girls' dresses and treat them like children while also sexualizing them. Because now you have unlocked some uncomfortable fetishes that shouldn't be animated and streamed to the public. Hell, they even sexualize one of them before we realize she's an adult.

If this had stuck with being a parody or at least set up boundaries to not cross then it would have been great. It has the setting and it has the humor, it just can't stop stumbling over its own shoelaces. Especially when it gets to the OVAs, which trucked along fine until the fifth installment, which should be sent in a rocket ship to the moon. I have nothing else to add to this the way most reviewers do. The animation is standard for the era, the characters are all stereotypes of the genre, the show is overall brief and can be blown through in roughly three hours (OVAs included). I just wish it hadn't gone in the direction it went in.

Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season Picture Drama

Mixed Feelings 





                The Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season Picture Drama offers a lighthearted and humorous look at the events that occurred throughout the series. The motion graphic spin-off series provides a comedic interpretation of the events that took place in conjunction with the anime. Originally released on the official Twitter page of the series, the Picture Dramas were included in the Blu-ray BOX sets. The voice cast for the Picture Dramas is the same as the Anime cast, which is definitely a plus for fans of the series.

Despite the Picture Drama's comedic nature, it does give us some insight into the characters that we don't
                  ...
get to see in the main show. For example, we learn that Hajime chose Yue over all the other girls, which some viewers may find disappointing. Additionally, the Picture Drama highlights the dangers of girls' night chatter and shows us that a mother's love knows no bounds.

However, some of the Picture Drama episodes do come across as strange and disjointed. For instance, Shea's interactions with the child leave the audience feeling uneasy, and some viewers may feel that Eri is even more annoying in the Picture Drama. Furthermore, some of the episodes feel like they're trying too hard to be funny, such as the One Piece and Overlord specials.

The Picture Drama does have its positives, including the fact that the animation is well done, and the opening and ending songs are still enjoyable to listen to. However, it's clear that less effort went into these episodes than the main show, as evidenced by the floating heads used in one episode instead of full character animations. Some viewers may also be confused by certain scenes, such as when Hajime considers a blob of slime over an alternative.

Overall, the Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season Picture Drama is a mixed bag. While it's a fun and lighthearted way to enjoy the series, some viewers may find it disjointed and too focused on humor. The Picture Drama is definitely not a substitute for the main show, and some viewers may feel that the budget for these episodes could have been better spent on improving the main series.

                Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou Season 2 was a series that I had mixed feelings about. Having watched the first season and being underwhelmed by it, I was hesitant to give the second season a try. However, I decided to give it a chance and see if it could redeem itself, and while it did improve in some aspects, it still had many flaws.

One of the most noticeable improvements in this season was the animation quality. While it was still not on par with other shows in the same genre, it was definitely an improvement from the first season. The battles were more dynamic and
                  ...
the character designs were more consistent. Additionally, the opening and ending themes were absolute bangers and I found myself jamming to them every time I heard them.

However, despite the animation being better, the characters were still one-dimensional and the plot was lackluster. Hajime, the protagonist, was still annoying and perverted, and while his backstory was explored more in-depth, it did little to make him a more likable character. The other characters in his group, while given some more development, still felt flat and uninteresting. The plot felt rushed and underdeveloped, with the writers seemingly cramming in as much action as possible without giving enough time for proper buildup. another issue with this season is the excessive amount of fan service, which is more annoying and perverted than I remembered from the previous season. It just felt like the show was trying too hard to pander to a certain audience rather than focusing on the plot and character development.

Overall, while Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou Season 2 had its moments, it still fell short of my expectations. The improved animation and music were a step in the right direction, but the weak characters and plot prevented me from fully enjoying the show. I would give this season a rating of 4.5/10, mainly because of the improvement in animation and the catchy opening and ending themes.

Overall: 4.5/10.

                This special episode of ""Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou"" was an absolute waste of time. Clocking in at a whopping 40 minutes, it felt like a never-ending nightmare that left me questioning why I even bothered to watch it.

The plot was a complete mess, and it was clear that the writers had no idea what they were doing. The story had no real purpose and was completely unrelated to the main plot, making it feel like an afterthought that was hastily put together.

To make matters worse, the animation was mediocre at best, with poorly choreographed fight scenes and lackluster character designs. The sound quality was
                  ...
equally disappointing, with forgettable background music and unimpressive voice acting.

Overall, ""Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou: Maboroshi no Bouken to Kiseki no Kaigou"" was a complete disaster. It lacked any real substance, failed to engage its audience, and left me feeling like I had wasted 40 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. I give it a generous 4/10, only because the end credits were decently animated.

                Yet another shitpost.

As this is just an unaired episode included in the first Blu-ray volume, there isn't much to say in terms of plot or character development. However, it's still worth noting that the episode doesn't offer anything particularly groundbreaking or essential to the story. It's more of a fun, lighthearted extra that fans of the series may enjoy.

In terms of animation and sound, there's nothing particularly noteworthy to mention. It's all fairly average and consistent with the quality of the main series. The characters also remain largely the same, without any significant growth or development.

Overall, I would give this unaired episode a solid 4/10.
                  ...
While it's not essential viewing for fans of the series, it's still a fun addition that offers a bit of lighthearted entertainment. Plus, it's always nice to see more of the characters we've grown to love.

...
The story does not exist. Just in case you could not tell, it is very episodic.
The artstyle is fitting for the story but the usage of 3d brings the visuals DOWN
the characters are very ONE-NOTE, Dedede hard carries not gonna lie.
I think kirby fans will enjoy the series to an extent. But it has a surprising lack of fanservice, and modern fans may not be getting what they desire.

                Bocchi the Rock (2022) has become an instant staple in the anime community recently

With a cute and colourful cast that will steal your heart even faster than the plague spread through Europe, Bocchi the Rock is perfect for weebs of any level of knowledge.

Even if guitars aren't your thing, how about cute bright coloured anime girls starting a band :D

This show focuses on the highs and lows of starting a band and to which any musician such as myself deem a must watch. The main cast are faced with realistic situations that they have to work together to solve. 

Studio CloverWorks really stepped up their

                I love hololive and this animation was just fantastic. I love all the little holo references and I believe some anime references? Love gooba and this was just overall a fun animation with a simple plot. This is supposed to just be a fun little short for hololive fans so there isn't any character building. Gura stays true to her character and it's cool seeing her origin.
Gura's voice acting was cute
The animation is so fresh and nice
Any hololive fan no matter how new you are will love this!
If you aren't into vtubers or more specifically hololive you probably won't like this that much though.
Can't wait
                  ...
for more animations for holo EN, the talents I mainly watch. One for Fauna would be amazing.

                It started as one of my season's favorite anime because I believed that the plot was super original... I mean we all have saw the tipical plot of the otome game but this one was different. 
At the beginning it started giving us that fresh air of originality that it had.. but at certain point it became repetetitive. 

Lieselotte having a lot of trusting issues is funny initially, but when you are in chapter 8 and half of the plot has move on you are like ""really?"" at this point you are still having that kind of issues? Not to mention than she has the
                  ...
strongest attacks of the witch when every couple is setted: Fiene and Bal, Sieg and her. Really are you going to be jealous about your ""sister"" when she has openly declare that has feelings for your cousin and vice versa? 

I saw all that inconvients as an excuse for extend the plot. And it wasn't enought because after all that, they starts to showing us the """"plot"""" about Endo and Kobayashi, that in my opinion it's the most boring thing that this anime has. It gave me, literally, sleep.

I don't know if I'm going to finish this anime honestly. When I think that I've already saw the 3/4 parts I think ""Hey, you can do it"" but I don't know if I'll achieve that.

                This is the second season of Tokyo Revengers, also known as Christmas Showdown.

So far, the series seems to be worth watching; In my opinion, there are many reasons to like and dislike this season but mostly in the former.

This season is a very good sequel to the first. The twists in the plot are not confusing but rather captivating. The personalities of the characters are also shown very well in the series, making it easy for the viewee to follow.

In summary, this season would be a good choice and a must watch-especially if you have watched the former season.

                Story is weak, although it features some core human things that some media makers have forgotten. 
In other words, despite it being ecchi, it's not a loathsome abomination like ""Big Mouth"" et al.

The chicks are into the guy. The guy is into the chicks. The chicks are pretty hot. There's fighting. 
Not always extremely smoothly animated, but, it's at least laid out and visualized in an appealing way.

The opening has a nice tune, the ending, too. The concept art book is great (although that is of course a side thing).

All in all, quite good anime, for visuals. Very appealing designs. And I don't just mean
                  ...
that they're revealing, but the proportions and shape language is very appealing. 
(This would be true even at smaller bust and ass sizes)

Certainly not a show with runts in it.
Turn off your brain, sit back, and enjoy something nice. Cause ironically, it's not even that gratuitous. It's very blatant, but not excessively gratuitous.

It's like sitting on a bench and a buxom, yet svelte yoga chick stands nearby. Not much left to the imagination, it's blatant.
But it's not 'pig tier raunchy'. That chick would look sexy doing most things, all with passive physicality. 

It's good, for what it is, and that's why I'm giving it a seven, but only on its own, with minimal comparisons to other works.

                Apparently lots of people don't like this anime and maybe I'm an idiot, but this is the most I've laughed since B Gata H Kei came out in 2010. I generally don't like Japanese comedy at all, so anything that makes me laugh gets a recommendation. I've learned watching dubs really helps me enjoy them. I find it very hard to laugh at comedy when reading jokes and hearing them in a different language because comedy is all about timing and delivery, something I can't appreciate in a language I don't speak. Hearing the proper inflections for the jokes in English really helps get the
                  ...
comedy across properly. The entire bit about staying up super late is a great example of this. I watched it in both japanese and english. It's just WAY funnier in English as a native English speaker.
 I didn't really like any of the characters very much at first, but by episode 4 I was pretty on board. They're more cliche than not, but I think the show is trying to take these types of characters to the absolute extreme in terms of how you see these archetypes presented in most anime.
I especially like how they subvert your expectations with Carol. I really didn't like her at first but she became one of my favorites recently. I also think if you're complaining about sterotypes and cliches in rom com animes, what are you even doing watching them? 90% of all anime is terrible and that's probably like 95% of romance/rom com anime because they're so lazy and cliche. Anime isn't really known for breaking conventions, it's one of the laziest forms of media when it comes to recycling established tropes, so I don't mind seeing stuff that's similar to what I've seen before as long as it's funny.

                Without a doubt, one of the best animes I've seen, full of a lot of drama, comedy, life stories, and above all time travel, which catches you from the beginning and as the chapters continue, so do the problems, where We went from seeing an egocentric and somewhat narcissistic protagonist, but who has great love for his friends, to a completely overwhelmed, stressed and depressed protagonist because of that same love for his friends. A great work that made me see time travel from a completely different perspective.

A cult work that I recommend you see and that deserves more recognition

                Yesterday I finished watching this sequel to Bleach and I must say that I don't understand the score it has on this page. From the start the animation was not the best and the artwork was uninspired. The characters were two-dimensional and the plot was very meh, knowing that this is the worst saga of all Bleach in general.

The story is rushed and too forced, with characters introduced and killed in a single episode, practically filler. There is no depth to the characters and the dialogue was often too boring.

The story is typical of a final fight of a series where everyone suddenly starts to
                  ...
die and power ups are taken from the ortho. And the villain on top is a tear

                ""SPY X FAMILY PART 2""

Genre- Action, Comedy, Shounen.

Things get tough in life and if you are a spy, then those difficulties are just going to unfold themselves 100 times more than they would in an average person's life. With a fight between information still going on between the East and the West frontiers, Twilight continues Mission Strix to preserve the peace between these two rival nations.

Picking up right where it left off, Part 2 of the anime breaks things down for us. With a little more insight into the main goal of the West & the East and, progress from Anya's side to get closer
                  ...
to the Desmond family, this sequel does lay out everything for us. While it makes progress with Operation Strix, it still holds on to the side-story aspect of it, giving us lots of other things to focus on, like the dog incident, Anya's daily difficulties, the tennis incident, etc. And also with these amazing events, we cannot forget the introduction of our two new characters, Bond and Fiona, who just shine the anime even better with the development of our other MCs.

On the side of technicalities, animation has really good progress which makes the second part just so much better. And while the sequel keeps up with everything from its first part, you cannot help but notice a lot more gore and intensity, which helps to give it a lot more depth and emotional check, making it an anime we can really connect to.

This anime is absolutely a ""MUST WATCH.""

                People are weirdly salty about this show, idk why. There's nothing wrong with this anime. It's a solid 7/10. It's entertaining, has decent mech designs, the characters don't act ridiculous, and the plot is coherent and simple. It's not a deep show. It's not an amazing show. But I certainly can't think of anything I didn't like or anything that makes it a bad show. I respect small, contained anime that don't try to be something they are not and don't have a wide-sweeping plot they aren't ready to handle.

Just because it's a mecha show doesn't mean it should be compared to Gundam. The plot
                  ...
here is much ""smaller"" / more containe, less complex than your average Gundam series. This show is also significantly less dramatic than a Gundam series.

If you just want to watch an entertaining, coherent, self-contained, decent mecha anime then this is a great pick for that. I would only not watch this show if, for some strange reason, you are expecting a Gundam show. Then no, absolutely do not watch since this is much smaller, simpler story.

                “World's End Harem” is what happens when an intern is given two different scripts, told to take them to the director, drops them then mixes them together while picking them up in an attempt to cover up the fact that he has a drinking problem. 

There is a polish movie from 1984 called “Sexmission”. Watching this anime reminded me of it. The premises have a lot in common. That said “Sexmission” is a classic, well written and a bit cheesy movie and “World’s End Harem” is something You’ll forget a few minutes after the last episode wraps up. 

We experience the world from the perspective
                  ...
of 2 equally boring and bland protagonists:

Number 2 aka Reito Mizuhara - former med student that after awakening to the new world decides he doesn’t want to play ball with the powers that be and starts his own research to help the world. He has his own harem of girls that in the beginning try to mate with him but soon enough they give up and just help him with his work.

Number 3 aka Shouta Doi - a bullied highschool student that after mating with his awesome, big breasted teacher (yes, the teacher is my weak spot) starts to enjoy his new reality. His harem is full of just slave girls that love everything he does. He’s just a dumb, terribly written self-insert. His story starts similar to #2’s but soon it turns into almost a revenge porn type of story and ends like a villain origin story. 

Compared to #2’s #3’s story is boring and bland. That’s something that should never be said about a story about debauchery. Unlike Reito, Shouta is mostly a passive character that is more than happy to be a puppet as long as he gets his way with women. There were moment where I wanted to skip his parts and rejoin #2’s story. 
Reito’s story is actually almost well made. It’s not a bland ero-comedy like Shouta’s, but almost a drama that turns into a sci-fi political thriller. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nothing close to “The Hunt For Red October” but is still pretty interesting and it has potential to be solid if given to someone who actually can write.

The powers that be are way more interesting than anything we see but that could be blamed on the fact that we don’t know that much about them, their motivations, MO and struggles. What we do get is the world they created with all its flaws and… it’s mostly flaws. It’s obvious a world created to be abolished but still curious.

I know I gave it a 4, and I stand by this, but this anime can be enjoyable. You just have to skip all the things associated with #3 and his part of the story.

                It goes hard, okay? Remington inspired me to check this show out, and here I am. This is a masterpiece beyond belief, honestly when my  computer screen assaulted my eyes with heavily saturated colours I knew this was a 10/10. The dialogue, whilst barely coherent manages to hold my attention better than any of the greatest show of the past century. The story, whilst being confusing as all hell and practically non-existent makes me want to scour the wiki for any more drops of lore. The animation is clearly top notch, and any glance at the visuals of this show can easily be mistaken
                  ...
for that of a MacDonald's commercial from 1967, but it is a competitor with juggernauts such as Demon Slayer or Fate.

Perhaps the show's only downfall is that it is unwatchable sober or alone. Get in a damn discord call and this is the funniest shit you've seen in a long time. If you watch it alone, well God have mercy on your poor soul.

Remington, you have good taste. A fine palate. You are truly the voice of the people.

                I grew up watching this anime since I was 5-6. My image of this show as a kid is a perfect story of a player who loves football with cool music and animation, it inspired me to pursue football and other sports. I decided to rewatch the anime for nearly after 20 years. With today's standards, I think it's really off the charts in a bad way; the animation is not good, the plot has flaws, it has a lot of flashbacks to previous episodes and obviously is not created to binge watch. 

But it defined created great childhood memories for me and many others
                  ...
in many different countries. If I started watching this anime today, I think I wouldn't have liked it at all and probably would drop it in the first/second episode. But since I have a history with it, I like it.

                I was very disappointed with ""Inu ni Nattara Suki na Hito ni Hirowareta."" The plot was lacking, and the characters were poorly developed. The animation and soundtrack were average at best. I was also horrified by the perverted content in the anime, especially the themes of bestiality, which I found to be morally wrong. I did not enjoy this show and would not recommend it. While the idea of a boy turning into a dog and being taken in by a girl sounded interesting, the execution fell flat. Overall, I found this anime to be a waste of time and was left feeling very shocked.

                Okay so death note it is a classic, it's amazing but idk maybe a different ending was needed because after the death of someone i'm not going to mention, the plot was loose and idk a different ending would have made me changed my answer to masterpiece, cause it's the perfect combination between topics of moral, religion, good vs evil.

It's an anime everyone should see if like to see and seek philosophical details.

Minimium spoilers
It makes you think a lot about Kira's plan and if it would have been a good plan if he did not go a litlle insane lol, in my opinion I think
                  ...
it was kind of a good plan but Kira was selfish and he wanted to have the power. I think there is where his plan fail, his need for power was stronger than his desire to create a good world
The power of that the death note gave him was a lot and he couldn't handle it in a sane way, at the end, all he wanted to do was to win L and his plan to save humanity from the evil was pushed aside.

                It is unimaginable to see how just an animation can portray many emotions and feel alive. This film gives off a magical vibe, but a different one than what we see on Disney and other fantasy romance films out there that we have grown into. This one is a 10/10 not just because of the plot but also for its creativity and production. They really do take animation seriously in Japan. 

I am a sucker for Asian romantic movies and series but nothing beats Makoto Shinkai's animated romantic fantasy film. The plot twist was the most unusual and unforgettable twist that I have watched throughout
                  ...
my life,  it was well thought out and this film is proof that romantic genres can deviate from the predictable plots, improve cliche storylines and be exceptional by integrating it with other genres. 

I also want to mention the creativity and production of this movie. Every detail of the animation was breathtaking and nostalgic. I admired the realistic places that they included in the film set which gives a connection between the film and the audience watching it. Also, the unrealistic events that they have in the film made me hope that it could possibly happen in real life.

The soundtracks used in the film were performed by the Japanese band Radwimps. It was beautifully composed, the orchestra sounds were very majestic, and it added emotions to the film. Whenever I long for the love story of the two characters, I listen to all of the soundtracks included in the movie.

Everyone would like a continuation of the story but the film ended pretty completely and gave us a sense of relief when the character had the chance to reunite. The director was kind enough to not give a cliffhanger but also not impossible to have a sequel.

As for some debatable topics, this movie is heavily criticized by people who had gotten into watching anime earlier and would say that the storyline is not that shocking, and much more anime has better twists. I would say that this film might not be number one but it sure is included in the top films and has a memorable storyline. Prepare a bucket to shed your tears onto.

                Bocchi The Rock! :

""Abandoning your uniqueness is equivalent to dying"" 

Every episode just feels so incredible. The staff understands this story and its sentiment at such a deep level it's incredible. They laid off the crazy visuals and overly creative aspects to make the buildup to their playing more grounded and the focal point of the episode rather than the visual aspect itself, and then brought it out once they were in the clear. They know exactly what they want to do, and how to achieve it and it's just so awesome. They mix and match and play with a back and forth of everything
                  ...
to establish the baseline for the creativity of the series, and depending and content and context, branch out from that where they can. The realism seems to be a pillar of the series at this point, alongside the aggressive camera angles, and the relative visual creativity with Bocchi. But they don't reach past that, they don't search for a stronger piece to cling to or make use of this episode until the very end, and it works wonders.

Regardless of the creativity of the staff for this episode, their execution was nothing short of stellar. Was it just CGI? Was it rotoscoped like Bocchi's run earlier in the episode? They chose relatively low detail designs for the characters so the line is so incredibly blurry between all the different modes that without a point of reference in the same scene it's impossible to tell. Even then, they've been massaging CGI and 3d work into the backgrounds and props of the series so far so the line gets blurred even further. Whether a creative choice or one to cut corners while providing the best possible execution of their music I've no idea, but the work done is incredible from start to finish.

Bocchi The Rock just casually shows up each week to prove that it's even or better at basically everything than all the other seasonals out there right now, and then walks away as if nothing happened just so they can get ready to show up for next week too. It's incredible. They excel at 2d, 3d, rotoscoping, environment and background work, camera angles, art styles, animation styles, lighting and shading, just every step in the visual process is dominated by the staff at Cloverworks right now. And that's not even adding on top the creative work for things like the dialogue and interaction, the amazing efforts from the VAs, and so on and so forth. Just sort of incredible to experience this level of polish and passion each week.

Obra Maestra...

                I had high hopes for this, it’s has my favorite trope rarely shown in media where there a male mc who falls in love with a girl who’s his complete opposite in a good way. It’s kinda projects my taste in men ig nerdy & cute in a way. 

Sadly it’s too perverse which anime & manga creators can’t seem to not have in their works from fear of low viewership. Started watching anime in primary school so perverted stuff used to go over my head but im a grown woman now & don’t want to watch perverted scenes between highschool students or minors due
                  ...
to that i can rarely enjoy it now. Would’ve seriously enjoyed this if it weren’t for that. 

Many of you will probably think thats a bad reason to not like it but it’s just called having morals.

                Not good at all, unfunny jokes. Bad compared to the other FMA. 
The story moved far from the source material in my opinion. Edward was less patient as a character in this one compared to the other one. The depth I saw in the other anime is missing here. Sorry, I couldn't take this particular adaptation seriously. Left after watching it for some episodes. I tried to give it a shot but it did not stand up to the serious story-telling.
FMA was more solid. The animation was more engaging in that one compared to this. I would recommend you to go and watch the other
                  ...
one.

                So I stumbled across this old anime through the mal database and decided to to check it out as it's on youtube. My thoughts are it's not that bad, yes the plot has some serious issues and the story is weird and definitely janky as heck but I did enjoy what I watched. The art is very good considering its the 80's it looks very high quality and the action sequences are fun to watch. I also like the character desgins and backgrounds and overall artstyle. The music is nice and I dont have any issues with the voice acting. Now the story it's not
                  ...
the best, it feels like a lot of scenes that don't connect to tell an overall story and the narrative is very choppy and janky that being said, I could still follow the story enough and the characters were engaging, and I did enjoy the Greek mythology setting, even though I felt the producers didn't do their proper research. Another issue that I do have with the story is I'm not exactly sure what the theme and overall message is, it's very unclear and messy. However because of the animation, world, characters and actions scenes I still feel this was an enjoyable film and if you can get past the weak plot I think any anime fan who enjoys retro shows will like. Overall 6/10.

Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu Part 2
(Anime)

        (All reviews)
      







Mar 6, 2023

                Note: Mushoku Tensei season 1 part 1 + part 2 = LN Vol 1-6

1. World Building
2. Character’s life
3. Story

1. World Building
Mushoku Tensei is an excellent isekai anime. We always refer to Isekai as another world that is typically a fantasy world of Sword and Sorcery. However, most isekai anime tend to create a world with Japanese RPG-style elements and a lot of game designs. On the other hand, ""Mushoku Tensei"" focuses on creating the epic fantasy world of Sword and Sorcery.  This world has its own history, culture, myths, beliefs, languages, geography, etc.
Have you known the theory of Flat Earth?  In LN Vol
                  ...
2, Six-Faced World is a world in hexahedral form where all beings live on its planes. It exists in a die-shaped structure with a total of six faces, each face is constituted of one world ruled by one God each, with another seventh world of nothingness inside the die-structure.  Each face is flat and separated by barrier. 
In the history, Human and Demon had started 3 Great Human-Demon War in total.  But anime didn't describe these interesting setting and story.


2. Character’s life
'Each person is an individual' and 'Everyone has their own life. are the subject of Mushoku Tensei.  The characters are like a real person you met in reality.  They have their own logic, ideas, experiences and perspectives. The main character’s understandings or thoughts are often different from those of the other characters. This is why the MC has misunderstandings, conflicts and even fights with them. Besides, wifu characters and even side characters have their own life.  They are not a tool for serving MC and the story. They have their own goals in life, so they will decide for themselves how to live their lives.
Unlike some stories, these characters are only there to highlight the power of the main character, who decides the direction of their lives. 
For example, Roxy can't cast magic without chanting, but her student can. It hurts her self-esteem.  That's why she wanted to leave Rudy and decided to continue her studies in magic.  If this was a normal isekai, maybe it would be about her getting stronger with the MC.
Characters have both advantages and disadvantages. No one is perfect. For example, Paul is a play boy. That’s why he cheated on his wife, Zenith. However, if Paul is just a bastard, he wouldn’t have had to take the responsibility for finding his family after the mana disaster happened.
Some reviews always focus on Rudy’s Pedophilia.  As a LN reader, I don't think Rudy is a pedophile because he has not shown any sexual desire for minors since he became an adult. (It will show the detail in season 2.)
Adulthood in this world is 15, after all it is an old world where there is no compulsory education and no concept of child labor, which is why Rudy was introduced to tutoring for money by his father at such an early age.
Rudy was also a minor in the season 1. Perhaps his mental age is 34, but his body has been reborn. Remember what he said in the episode 1? He said, ""Maybe because she's my mother, I don't have any sexual desire for her.” This body affects the senses of his brain. This’s why he interacted with girls of his own age.
Except for Eris, you could find that Rudy has a degree of respect for other female (The worst behavior is peeking or stare. Yeah, we should agree that Rudy is a dirty lech.)  If he really wanted to touch their bodies, he would ask their will.  For example, Rudy asked to see Ghislaine's tail and touch her ass.
If you ask me why Rudy didn’t respect Eris at the beginning, it's because Eris was a spoiled brat. The willful, arrogant and violent young lady beat up Rudy every day. This made it difficult for Rudy to treat Eris like any other female. But Eris is the boss's daughter and has a strong vengeful streak, which made it impossible for Rudy to confront her. Don't forget that Rudy was actually physically smaller than Eris. This is why Rudy chose to paw Eris while she was sleeping to assuage Rudy's usual grievances.

3. Story
I listened some podcasts talking about Mushoku Tensei. One podcaster said, “You will feel very comfortable when you watch this story.  For example, when we watched the beast person at the beginning, it didn’t immediately introduce her background. We only got to know her personality, but then we started in an unexpected adventure to her homeland. We learned that the woman we know was once spurned by her homeland and her family. But when her brother heard about her current situation, he realized how much he regretted it. The story also shows that people can change. It is such a simple and comfortable way to be part of a world that has so many surprises waiting to be discovered, such as when the castle in the sky is going to be available! It reminds me of the spirit I had when I was young and wanted to go on adventures everywhere.” 
A good story can inspire people to express their thoughts.

                I want to take this time to just tell any people who are NEW to watching Anime or just want to BINGE a new season / show that they have never seen. DEATH NOTE is perfect for that. The storyline of this anime is just incredible. From the beginning of the show to the very end of it. It just keeps getting better and better. 

Summary: This boy finds a book called "" Death Note "" he is very confused about it until he writes a name in it and the person... You know... Dies! There is also this character named Ryuku. { I think
                  ...
thats how you spell his name. } He's my favorite character from the whole series in my opinion. 

Yea I'd say just watch it. I understand my summary was a little bad but I can tell you it's worth it. 

You can watch Death Note for free on Youtube, Tubi, Pluto TV, Peacock,
You can watch Death Note if you have a subscription for Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon Prime

They're similar because they're a group of high schoolers under one teacher and usually fight in groups; Bamboo Blade portrays ""official"" fights.

Bamboo Blade has less romance in it but more comedy. If you liked Fuji (the dog) in Gokusen or the Yakuza crying when acting like in a theatre play, you'd probably like Bamboo Blade for similar reasons.

If you liked Gokusen for the martial scenes, Bamboo Blade is also a good choice. They really show appreciation for kendo and the technical side of it, while also having females practicing and being great at it. reportAnime rec by oGINKOo - Today, 11:35 AM

In terms of the main leads' romance, these two are very similar. 

In Nanatsu no Taizai / Seven Deadly Sins, Meliodas is in love with the main FL lead, Elizabeth, the spitting image of his former lover, Liz. That is where Sugar Apple Fairy Tale has in common as Challe here has a deep affection (aka love) for Anne, who is also the spitting image of his former, beloved owner, Liz, by pure coincidence. 

Honestly, at this rate, I wouldn't even be surprised if the mangaka who wrote Sugar Apple Fairy Tale was inspired by Meliodas & Elizabeth's epic romance story lol.  reportAnime rec by zorn_wolf - Today, 12:01 AM

This really isn't odd considering both shows shared much of their talent. Sadly, Arakawa Under the Bridge doesn't reach the highs of the Monogatari series.

Both male MCs are transported to another world after dying. They also get some cheat skills/powers making them pretty powerful in what they are doing. The main similarity is town/farm development from scratch, populated with various race from monsters to elves.  reportAnime rec by Leifallen - Mar 2, 2023

Shiguang Dailiren
add



Both animes relate to time travel as the main focus. 
I think if you liked Steins; Gate then Link Click is a good choice when thinking of other animes to watch! Both have the sense of thrill and mystery. 
My personal opinion is that Link Click is much more engaging and is more fast paced than Steins; Gate. However if your in for the long haul Steins; Gate is good too! 

ANYWAYS TLDR, both will have you on the edge of your seat :) 10/10 recommend. reportAnime rec by Boofay - Mar 2, 2023

Weak to strong MC, luck happens upon. But the novel of Quanzhi Fashi is amazing! However Xing Yu Siwan Nian has thousand times better graphics in terms of animation xD. Quanzhi Fashi has little to no appeal as an anime. reportAnime rec by Mishkat4 - Mar 2, 2023

Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199
add



Space opera is a genre with a small, but devoted fanbase. There are very few recognizable space opera anime. Gundam Wing may now be considered an old anime, but it was a popular entry point into the Gundam franchise and an excellent example of space opera anime. Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 is a more recent space opera anime, but did not gain the same level of popularity outside of Japan. However, it is easily one of the best space opera anime in the last 15 years, which speaks more to the lack of new space opera anime. You will undoubtedly enjoy these series. reportAnime rec by lancelot200 - Mar 1, 2023

Parts of GaoGaiGar are definitely visually similar to Evangelion -- they both have great high-detail animation, and the screens and explosions definitely reminded me of Evangelion. GaoGaiGar is a happier, technologically cooler, more family-friendly version of Evangelion which in some ways makes it superior to Evangelion for me because it removes the scary psychological scenes and existential angst.  reportAnime rec by PorthosMoonPower - Feb 28, 2023

The things that connect Komi Can't Communicate and School Rumble the greatest are their eccentric and fun casts of characters. Every character gets their fair share of screen time as well. The plots are simple enough too, there are just high schoolers doing regular high schooler things. There is romance in both, but the romance in School Rumble is more prevalent as it has relationships set up between the side characters, unlike Komi-san which mainly focuses on the relationship between the main characters. If you want a casual watch filled with lots of light-hearted amusement, watch both of these shows. reportAnime rec by Knuckle_Skull - Feb 28, 2023

How to Participate in the 2023 Isekai Journey!
Introduction
This year we have done something a little different.

We have lovingly created a visual novel inspired challenge that allows you to create your own story! Depending on what type of story you want to build, your challenge can be as short as 25 items, long as 85 items, or anything in between. There are 191 different challenge items scattered throughout the routes you can take.

Start out by reading the Introduction Story, then add the sign-up code to your post. Everyone will start with the same 15 items. Once 10 of those items are completed click the link at the bottom. You will make a story decision, which results in either reaching a route continuation, the next set of items, or a unique ending. Because of the complexity of the setup we won't be offering any official restrictions, but you may use personal restrictions if you wish.

A few things to note:
You must finish the previous set of items in order to continue (as in, the Completed Date for the set of items must be the same day or earlier than the Started Date for the next set of items)
Exception to this rule: Any anime that is 45 episodes or more with an episode duration of 20 minutes or more can be started/finished at any time during the challenge period
And yes, some items may be seen multiple times throughout the journey.


Signing Up & Completing Challenge Items
 
How to Sign Up
Scroll down to the Sign-Up Code post
Click the ""Show Sign-Up Code"" button in the post to view the BBCode
Copy everything inside the box that appears
Paste it as a new reply in this thread
How to Fill Out Your Form
Refresh the page after posting, as your post number may change if others posted right before you
Your initial post number is the number in the top right corner of your post - double check yours against the posts above you to determine if it is correct.If after making your post the post number changes, do not change your initial post number - this just means someone above you deleted their post
Fill in the header information and delete everything in brackets:Challenge Start Date -> The date the first anime was started for the challenge, regardless of when you signed up for the challenge
Challenge Finish Date -> The date the last anime was completed for the challenge
Anime in Forum Avatar/Signature -> The anime featured in your forum avatar and signature
Fill in the item information. The item codes copied into your post will look like this:
[Started: DATE] [Finished: DATE] (R7) Watch an anime featuring voice actors from at least three different languages on its Characters and Staff page
ANIME_TITLE
[*][color=GRAY][Started: DATE] [Finished: DATE][/color] (R7) Watch an anime featuring voice actors from at least three different languages on its Characters and Staff page
[url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/0000]ANIME_TITLE[/url]
[ * ] -> Do not delete/edit this, it gives you the proper list numbering
[color=GRAY] -> The colors can be changed to your liking (a BBCode color tutorial can be found here)
[Started: DATE] / [Finished: DATE] -> Fill in the date you started/finished watching the anime using MMM DD format (Jan 23, Aug 07, etc.)
[url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/0000] -> Replace 'https://myanimelist.net/anime/0000' with the anime's URL (found at the top of the anime's MAL page)
ANIME_TITLE -> Enter the main title as it appears on the anime's MAL page

The item will now look something like this:
[Started: May 01] [Finished: Jun 25] (R7) Watch an anime featuring voice actors from at least three different languages on its Characters and Staff page
Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon
[*][color=MEDIUMVIOLETRED][Started: May 01] [Finished: Jun 25][/color] (R7) Watch an anime featuring voice actors from at least three different languages on its Characters and Staff page
[url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/33206][color=TURQUOISE]Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon[/color][/url]

Continue completing challenge items until you've finished enough to move onto the next step in your story. Remember, each anime entry can only be used once.

Make sure to check the Challenge List with Explanations for further item explanations and helpful hints!

We are constantly trying to make the inspection process a faster one so please make sure to follow these guidelines: 
Do not alter the challenge list format
Leave the item, anime's title, and any extra information each on their own line, exactly as provided in the sign up code
Choose colors that are easy to read (avoid light colors (like this) or bright colors (like this))
Do not change the font size of the item list
If you have signed up and then later decide that you don't want to or cannot participate, please do not delete your post. See the ""Withdrawing from the Challenge"" section for instructions.
How to Add Routes
The bottom of the initial code you pasted into your post has a link to a post with route options
Click your desired routes and continue with the story
When you get to a post with more items copy the entire code in the Spoiler tags directly underneath the initial Sign-Up Post
Repeat until you reach an Ending
(Optional) Grab a participant banner from our AWC 2023 Donated Banners and show it off on your profile/forum signature.
　　— You can use them as soon as you post your sign-up/turn-in forms. To donate, please check the AWC 2023 Help Thread.
Turning In & Tips

Ensure all necessary information in the sign-up form is correctly filled in and all requested information is provided
Keep the provided format for the challenge item list.
For items that require extra information, display it in square brackets on a new line below the anime title Dates should have brackets on both ends and be in a consistent format (Jan 01 vs Jan 1)
Remove any unused or additional items (delete them or move them to a separate spoiler at the end of your post) 
All listed anime should have the same title as its MAL page main title. This includes all punctuation
For example: ""Working!!!"" should include the !!! at the end
Similarly, titles like ""Houseki no Kuni (TV)"" and ""Appleseed (Movie)"" should include the bit in parentheses
Do not copy the anime title from the URL - ""Uta_no☆Prince-sama♪__Maji_Love_1000"" is not correct; it should be ""Uta no☆Prince-sama♪: Maji Love 1000%""
A link to each anime's MAL page should also be included
Decide how we should treat your form:
Inspection -> No invalids, all required information is there, dates are in order
No inspection -> Challenge Start/Finish Date are in order
To turn in, copy and paste the code below into a new reply in this thread.
Don't change this form's color when posting.
Edit your post to replace the text in capital letters (LIKE THIS) with your information.
To get MSGID_LINK, click the post # (top right of the blue bar) of your sign-up post, and copy the URL; e.g. https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=X#msgY

Invalids

What happens if I have an invalid after turning in my challenge?
If during the inspection of your challenge there is an anime that doesn't fit the item requirements, you will be asked to either:
Keep the same item and replace the invalid anime with a valid one watched during your challenge period (between your Challenge Start Date and Challenge Finish Date)
Keep the same item and watch a new anime as a replacement after your Challenge Finish Date
Keep the invalid anime and move it to a valid and previously unused item from the challenge item list
If you have invalids, you may also choose to shuffle anime around to make them valid, within reason
If you do this you MUST explain in your PM what changes were made or corrections cannot be verified
Note that you must respond to the AWC_mod PM so that corrections can be verified

I Just Wanted To Make Some Progress On My 2023 Yearly Anime Challenge Now That It Has Finally Been Released, But Instead I Was Somehow Transported To Another World Where Light/Visual Novel Tropes Are Commonplace?!
The day started off like any other. It was early January and the AWC staff had FINALLY (what takes them so long anyway??) decided to release the 2023 Anime Watching Challenge. You had waited impatiently for days on end, constantly refreshing the MyAnimeList Anime Discussion Forum page to check if the challenge had shown up. You happened to hit refresh mere moments before the Hosts pinged the AWC participants on Discord to let everyone know that the challenge had dropped. Your lightning-quick fingers nimbly clicked on the link, keyboard smashed some characters into the reply box, and hit send. With a cry of victory, you refresh the page and find yourself the proud owner of a coveted post on the first page!

You quickly scanned the first few challenge posts for the code you needed to add to your own post, making a mental note to maybe read the rules later. For now you're super eager to just get started on your first anime of the year. Partway through scanning the information, a section of large text catches your eye:

In order to proceed with the challenge, you must register using this link. It will only take a few moments!
Curious, you click the link. At first there was a small section of text in the middle of the screen, but it disappeared too fast for you to make it out. Then the screen started fading to black. Thinking that the page had failed to load properly you go to hit refresh, but your cursor doesn't move. Did the computer just freeze? Did AWC just give you a virus???

Just before you can stand up to manually shut off your computer, the screen comes back to life. This time the words stayed on the screen:

Be warned, dear Participant, your journey will not be easy. Do you still wish to proceed? 
[ Y ] / [ N ]

A little dramatic of the staff to write that, but of course you want to proceed! Still, you feel a bit nervous as you hover your mouse over the options. As soon as you click the 'Y', the screen fades to black again. This time it felt different, almost as if the screen was... melting? You draw your eyes into the very center and start to feel very disoriented. You feel your body start to sink forward.

Then you are falling...

You shake your head, still slightly woozy. Very funny, AWC Staff, you got me good. Placing your hands on the ground to push yourself to your feet, you stop in confusion. There was... grass between your fingers. You were touching grass. What... is going on??? You finally take a good look at you surroundings.

You are sitting in what looked like the clearing of a forest. You can't think of any forests near your house, where the heck was this? It's almost as if you're in some sort of isekai novel or something... With a laugh, you shake your head. Impossible. That stuff never happens to average... wait, it usually happens to average, everyday people like you... But that can't happen for real, right? Right? Well whatever had happened, whether you had fallen and hit your head or were dreaming or something, one thing was for certain; you are DEFINITELY not in your room anymore.

""Hey!"" A gruff voice calls out from behind. You turn around and see what appears to be a glowing blue square with wings. Before you can say anything, the voice continues.

""Listen, I don't have much time; a bunch of yas are spawning in at once, so I'll be brief. I'm Mavi and I'm the fairy assigned to making sure you can settle into this world properly. Here's 10 Gold and a map, you're gonna wanna make your way to the town just north of here. From there, you can decide what to do next.""

Finally able to get a word in, you ask: ""So you're like a parody version of Na-""

""Watch it kid, I don't like 4th wall breaks and if you keep at it, I'm just gonna leave"", he growls. You promptly shut up, taken aback by how aggressive his tone is. ""I'll pop up in town later to give you a basic lowdown in a spoiler. Won't spoil the story, but should be able to help ya make a more informed pick. That's all there is to it, I'm out.""

Before you can ask any follow-up questions, the curt fairy zooms off above the foliage. ""Well, alright then,"" you sigh. With no other leads, you decide to heed his advice and make your way to the town...

I'm definitely worse at expressing myself than other people are. But, even so, the truth is... The truth is I've always... Just, wanted someone to completely understand how hard and painful it is... Wanting to scream and cry but not being able to express it. But even understand a little is okay.AeradaeJan 2, 12:37 AM

                It's honestly difficult not to recommend this. If you love Evangelion and want more Evangelion, you should read this. Think of this as a bonus scene for Evangelion 3.0. It depicts a nice little interaction between Asuka and Mari before the events of Evangelion 3.0 transpire. It's definitely nothing groundbreaking or shattering (in part because of its very short length), but it adds a greater context to Evangelion 3.0. The art is stunningly detailed too; it looks like the art could have jumped right off the screen. Overall, this is some nice supplementary material for the Rebuilds of Evangelion, and it probably would be a
                  ...
good idea to read this if you enjoyed Evangelion.

                I want to start out with the fact that this is my absolute favorite manga in the whole world. period. 
To start out with is that I really love the first arc. It was great with andc got me hanging on to every word. Then... it ended. I will admit that it did get a bit worse from there and I was really disappointed in *COUGH* a certain person coming back to life *COUGH* but I did enjoy the goldy pond arc. I don't really feel like writing an entire essay so I'll just say this. Although it might be overrated, I do believe it
                  ...
is definitely worth at least the first few volumes and if you don't like it? Fine. But, I do think that this is still a great story and deserves more credit then some of the reveiws give it.

                I  have mixed feelings about this. I personally enjoyed it, however as I'm sure you've seen in other reviews... There are definitely some issues. The first thing I'd like to point out though, is the art. It is in my opinion absolutely adorable. 10/10. I'd also like to mention that though the mc might be a little 2D, honestly she isn't that bad and as far as mcs go she might be one of the better ones that I've come across. The plot of this story isn't amazing, but it's not bad at the same time, and I was interested enough to finish all
                  ...
the chapters (that are currently out). 
Now time to look at the worse side of things
yes, straight up phodophiles in this, and i agree it would be a better story without that teacher. However I mean if you can skip over that part overall it's not a terrible story if you are alright with skimming over, or reading it. It definitely isn't for everyone.

                This shoujo manga is a bit of a hidden gem. My Pink is Overflowing (and can I just say, what a title...) is basically a short romance series where the main girl is thirsty as hell, but tired of being considered ""easy"" and just getting toyed with by playboys. After a literal page one sex scene that's crashed by the revelation that her boyfriend is two-timing her (on page two...) our heroine comes to the epiphany that the solution to her perpetual boy troubles is obvious. She can avoid all the playboys... by only dating virgins! Fortunately for her, it doesn't even take until the
                  ...
end of chapter 1 to find one, and he's a real dreamboat to boot. Unfortunately for her, that boy is straight-laced as they come and totally committed to saving himself for marriage and ""dating with the idea of marriage in mind"".

From there, literally 80% of the manga is MC swooning at her dreamy hunk of a socially awkward virgin boyfriend, and attempting to tempt him through the tried and true method of steamy risqué shoujo scenes. And I'm totally here for it. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sexy, sometimes it's endearing, but the end result is a pretty lovable and entertaining duo. Think of B Gata H Kei (which, if you haven't read and somehow got here first, you totally should!) but with a much more ""experienced"" female lead and with the steam dial turned up to max. And I mean, sure, if you want to get technical there's a regular shoujo plot outside of that in the intervening panels - a love rival or two, a brief foray into the characters' relationship with the parents, what have you - but none of that really matters. This manga is about not-quite-pornographic, racy but vanilla bedroom scenes of the kind liable to induce a nosebleed in your median Japanese teenage girl. And it excels at this task.

But I have to say that despite the way I'm making this manga sound like it's nothing more than erotica, it's actually pretty wholesome and I really liked the dynamic of this couple. It's not very often we get a borderline-nympho girl as the main lead in a shoujo manga, and much less often we see her complemented by a less assertive, less experienced boy - and even less often we see them both taken seriously. The two of them aren't just played off as a comedy gag. This manga definitely errs more on the side of rom than on com, it treats the characters and their relationship seriously, and it somehow works out beautifully. Score one for the war on slut-shaming here.

As to the aesthetics the quality of the art is pretty above average, minimal but clean, distinctly shoujo but modern sylistically. It's not an award-winning masterpiece by any means, but it sure was well-crafted and a lot of fun. Overall I give My Pink is Overflowing a solid 8/10 and do strongly recommend it to any fan of shoujo manga who's in the mood for something a bit more spicy.

But before I wrap this up there's just one more thing I have to point out. What's really crazy is just how underrated this series is on MAL. At the time of writing, it has a score of only 6.88 with only 160 users having even scored it! That's really low for a manga that's by any metric at least half decent, and fully translated / officially licensed in English. I feel bad for Kodansha, having gone to the trouble of publishing this and apparently not seeing any return on their investment. So if this review's convinced you... please support the official release!

                Easily one of the most exciting action SJs, simple and beautiful. Overall I think the story does just a fantastic job for a quick easy read action manga.

Story 7/10

The plot is linear and absolutely simplistic. Don’t expect any elaborate twists and complexities. But you can appreciate the constant story progression in exciting action sequences with overall cool themes. 

Art 9/10
The characters are drawn intentionally simple and silly, but it works! The author shows she can create beautiful detail that shows action scenes impeccably. From light hearted goofy faces to the pinnacle of intense life on the line battles, it really doesn’t disappoint!

Characters 8/10
...

The characters aren’t super dynamic but they are well designed to be enjoyable. The female characters are just as good as the male cast in terms of power and enjoyment which we know doesn’t happen often. What did shock me is that the amount of conviction the characters all have putting their lives on the line and sometimes actually dying.

Would like to give this 8.5-9/10

                So this was a ""i'll fix that villain yandere or yeet him to nonexistance"" fairy tale-like comedy. Like most romance manhwa it's nothing grand really but it'll prove to be an enjoyable read on the condition you don't take it seriously. It's meant to be a whimsical but slightly angsty ride afterall.

What's most promising about this manhwa in my opinion, is probably what most readers would find problematic. That is its trashbag yandere ML. He's a sneaky, scheming, manipulative, cold-hearted boisterous brat. Toxic obsessive and easy to hate. Just like many rofan MLs out there you'd say but our dear Bluey pushes the readers' buttons
                  ...
and triggers our flight, fight or freeze instincts a couple of times. He's a cold mofo. He stops at nothing to get what he wants and he isn't the least bothered by destroying other people's lives, including the person he cares about the most. A true psychopathic yandere wouldn't you say? At least he's consistant and lives up to the name unlike many wuss pseudo-villain male leads. 

Mari (FMC) was an interesting girl. She had a lot of desirable traits as the main character. I liked her determination and sheer power of will. She's obstinate, courageous and confident. I liked how she goes through her plans without a care in the world. She's not afraid to stick up to Bluey. She isn't afraid to voice her opinion. She isn't scared of offending anyone if need be. She doesn't compromise (unless she actively desires to). She doesn't take no BS from anyone (except her annoying-but-lovable besties). She laughs off the small stuff. She readily receives love and readily gives it back too. She can be clumsy and act cringe at times (it's forgivable since she's a teenager in love) but she doesn't back down when told to which makes her very easy to root for. I'd love to see more female leads act like her in the future. Granted they'll  act less cringe.

I can't really spoil any specific plot details in this story but i'll give you a vague headsup. I'd say that although i liked Bluey's twisted character and Mari's thick skin the most. I can't say i'm satisfied with the lukewarm romance. Feels like they skipped all the good fluffy parts. We just got what felt like a succinct summary of their ""promising"" slightly-twisted love life that we expected but didn't really get to see. Which is a tad disappointing since i was looking forward to their lovely interactions, considering they might have been hissing and barking at each-other like cats and dogs the whole time. I still enjoyed their love-hate antics and push and pull exchanges so it wasn't all that unrewarding.

I'd have given this story a 7 but the ending felt very rushed as if it was axed. I was looking forward to the last arc but Mari's cringy act kept giving me second-hand embarrassment. I even contemplated skipping a few chapters because of it. Thankfully i didn't since the awkward comic relief was there.
In the end, i'm still quite satisfied with the general outcome. I emphasize that the fairy tale-like structure and the leads' thorny relationship dynamics were the highlight of this story. Give it read if you have some time to spare.

                                      (68/? chp)
                                   





                Juujika no Rokunin is a revenge manga with as much width as a kiddie pool and as much depth as a puddle.
TL;DR below for the lazy.

The first 10 or so chapters are genuinely not bad and hook you to the story, but very quickly you will realize that the illusion of depth for both the story and characters you get in those chapters quickly fade the more you read.

Story - Main character is bullied by a group of kids, said kids decide to kill his parents and nearly kill his brother. Why? Because why not. That is the reason given and frankly I don't hate
                  ...
it, I like the idea that characters are evil and do shit just because why not, but I also expect said characters to have depth, but more of that in the character section.
Anyway our main character Uruma decides to move in with his ex military Grandfather to train to kill these bullies for revenge. It is a simple revenge story with a good hook and setup, but falls apart from plot contrivances and inconsistencies. Characters going from point A to point B because why not. Characters doing 180s because of drama/plot e.t.c.
Overall it is a 3/10. Too contrived and all over the place, but the setup was well done and it kept me reading for as long as I did, despite everything.

Characters - The only interesting characters in the story are Uruma, his grandfather and Kyou, the leader of the bullies. Everyone else is as surface level as they can get and sadly, this is especially true for the other bullies. They are all comically evil with 0 redeeming qualities, besides one very small and short instance, you are never wondering if these characters have a reason for doing what they do and all of them have very surface level characterisation. I initially thought that all of them would have at least some interesting quirks or something else going on about them, but no, all of them are violent, murderous rapists. Yup that is pretty much it. Maybe it is because of the shounen designation and it being aimed at young boys that the author can't really dive too deep into fleshing them out as characters due to the nature of the story, but these characters would have all benefited in a seinen franchise where the author would have had a lot more freedom in how he handles them.
This is especially true for Chizuru, what would be considered the main female character that feels tacked on, because we need a female lead. Why? Because it is a shounen. At first I wasn't too mad about her, I thought she would develop and become something like a follower of Uruma similarly to Kyou and the other bullies to drive home the fact that Uruma isn't all that different from them, but no, she literally just exists for the sake of existing and that is that.
Overall, a 3/10 as well, very few good characters and the rest are cliche with no real depth.

Art - Simply put, I like it. I like how rough it is and how well it goes with the story. I like the faces the author draws for characters and the environments look decent too. Not much to complain about really. As with many ongoing manga, the art becomes cleaner the longer it goes on and the same is true here, but the overall grit and roughness is still there 70+ chapters in so I don't have too many complaints.
 7/10

Enjoyment - Despite how many negative things I've said, my overall enjoyment was pretty decent as I turned my brain off and looked at this manga for what it is. edgy, gory revenge porn. And for that it is pretty decent. As long as you don't invest yourself too much in the story, it is an ok read. That said, my enjoyment has steadily been declining the more I read and frankly I don't see myself coming back to this manga any time soon. Maybe when it is finally finished I can binge it and give my complete thoughts, but as it is my enjoyment was fine, overall. 
5/10

TL;DR: Has a decent premise but fumbles the bag pretty early on with a surface level cast and a story that goes all over the place. Has solid art and was fairly enjoyable once I turned off my brain and read it for what it was. Wouldn't really recommend it still, due to a lot of scenes of r + ape, like, really a lot, which I can handle but I know a lot of people can't. But the gore is enjoyable at the very least so there is that for all of the gore enjoyers. Maybe it will get better in the next 50 or so chapters, but I highly doubt it.

For anyone looking for a good revenge story, look at Oshi no ko, from the author of Kaguya Sama. It is much deeper and better realized than this manga will ever be.

                The same mangaka as Kamisama Hajimemashite and frankly I enjoyed the story a bit more than Kamisama Hajimemashite and it's mainly due to the cute couple who are our main characters. Recommended for sure!
Our Couple is truly the highlight of this story. From the moment our FL summons the ML by accident to the end everything is just super sweet and the development of their love makes sense. it feels natural.

Good for light reading with fluff, demons and shojo romance.

I like the art style too. The supporting cast is good especially Mako. I would love learn more about our MC's mother and her contract. Sounds
                  ...
like it would be an interesting story.
All in all a good story to binge read and have fun!

                SO yeah, a preliminary review of it.
Not the first kill the corrupted heroes type and with it being a monthly release it will be a while before arcs really show if it is good or not, but it is fine at the moment?

It made me think of the books I used to write of psychopaths that I never published.
  With this kind of manga, the only concern I have is if it will be dropped, as it is currently( from what i see) not that popular. We shall see. I never got past chapter 13 in my published writings( may seem unrelated, but it
                  ...
is). These kinds of works get boring to write after a while, and as they don't get that much support due to the gore...

Ah, I suppose I should actually write about the current content. The art is fine, 8.5? Better than most isekais, but that is expected considering the rare release.

The characters are also about normal for this genre, with the MC gimmick being more....
Original? 

Anyway, I suppose I reccommend this? I would just not suggest to have big expectations, better to be impressed than not.

[spoiler]The whole being abilityless, but with the book about the reincarnators...
honestly, I don't get how the goddess can't make an ability that also gives her a clause to kill the receiver if she wants, That would have been more practical then sending someone powerless.[spoiler]

                Did I just make an account to rate this manga? Yes, Yes I am
Unfortunately, despite me giving a 10(Masterpiece) , which by all means, Syundei and this story totally deserves it. 
It gives 6 chapters makes there some things that can and should have been explored more. However, I can understand why Syundei didn't do it as they have other projects as well. 
Only having 6 chapters itself didn't hinder the story theme for me, but it did leave me wanting more (only that and that is my own personal feelings)
After all, I will recommend this to everyone who likes Dark Theme Yaoi Manga.

                holy shit dude, this is one of the best manhwa i've ever read!!
tbh, i didn't have any expections for this to begin with. i thought this would the same old clichéd story with the L mc who got into some kind of fuss or smh, but it turns out to be even more than that. 

it's about a guy whose life is fucked up so he decided to take his own life as an escapism cuz he didnt have any choice (nd he was broke too 😃🔫). you may ask why did he take his own life? welp, cuz he thought death is just a
                  ...
""tool"" to end his misery nd from then the whole scenerio got changed!!  

this manhwa has everything a ""just like me protag"", a perfect plot, great pacing nd some epic moments which makes this a worthwile read!! 
if u really wanna read smh good, then this would be up in ur alley. if u r not into manhwa/webtoon that much then u too will enjoy this for sure :)

thanks for reading!

                The story is interesting, good art, good fighting panels. My only gripe is the art eventually changes and it literally hurts my head whenever there is an action scene, there is just so much scribble that it gives me a headache when I try to appreciate the battle. I dropped it for the time being because of that, it's just not fun when you have no clue what is happening.

Overall I'd give it a 7 because it is not a boring manga and it actually has somewhat of a story, and it comes in Deluxe volumes so it makes it more enjoyable.

                I am not a samurai fan , and therefore i can clearly say , it’s one of the most amazing work i have ever read :

-art style : it’s so simplistic and yet so impactful , it make the battle so clear i love it  9.5/10
-characters : there is no good , but only bad people and scum here , each one of their story is well written , so well , that sometimes you dont’ want to return on the main characters timeline ( and they are good) the chara design is absolutely god tier 10/10
-story : you won’t be bored  ,
                  ...
i feel like there is no exceedîng chapters , useless chapter or boring time on it 7.5/10
-thematical : quality ( badass swordsmans)over quantity (normal citizens) ? Blood over peace ?  add to that a revenge led by a 16 years old girl  who’s teacher is an immortal and immoral man . 9/10
Little bonus : the gore and the violence is well mastered +1

If you love awesome characters with awesome fight in a seinen way this is for you 

9/10

                                      (100/? chp)
                                   





                Here is my honest point of view for this manga : 

Goodpoint:
-art style : it’s really different , the use of black and white scenery make this world amazing . 8.5/10
-thematical : for those who like budhisme and the why of the life , your served it’s overflowing . 9/10
-originality : i’m always amazed by authors who can create a world with nothing commonly in it , there is no basement of society . 10/10
-dialogue : the dialogue are really enjoyable , it make me remember monogatari series , and the panel cutting are exceptionnel  10/10

Badpoint :

-characters : honestly i have rarely seen a
                  ...
main character as dumb as this one , making the same mistake again and again , also i feel that 1/3 to 1/2 side characters are useless  , and let’s not forget anout the lacks of feeling from the gems , who give you a feeling of nobody care 3.5/10

-story : enjoyable at first until the 30 first chapter , but after a while it get repetitive and just plain . 5/10

-the battle system : i think the author just forgot about it , the fights are boring fighting the same npj and the system of hardness make no sense since everybody break of the same manner 2/10.

Overall 7/10 : it’s kind of a slice of life with celestial beings

                i have to be serious, this manga changed my life lol
while i read it i became really fixated in the job the mc had and after that i started to learn more about graphic design and arts and stuff like that
as someone that had a big prejudice against this area, this manga changed my view of it 
and i started studying in an art school!!! although im not doing graphic design because i discovered i didnt really like it, im doing sculptures and ceramic stuff as well as drawing, which i became fairly good at it!!
so yeah, if i had not read this manga i
                  ...
probably wouldnt have entered arts and wouldnt be as happy as i am now! (since i would probably have choosen anything history related) i re read this today, after 2/3 years and after i have forgotten even the name of this and went into reddit to try to find it, and i am extremely grateful for it!!!!
i dont remember where i got the recomendatiob but i wish i did,,,
thats it, if youre reading this, thank you!!!

                One of the most thought provoking mangas out there. I came for the psychopath and art and that is exactly what I've got.
I could go into detail, but there are too many reviewers already doing just that, so keep this in mind: {This is the disturbing exploration of a man who doesn't feel]. I suppose some will find the more gory scenes an exageration, but in the end it doesn't really matter. 

What really matters is that you feel good in your own skin, and that is a personal effort.

As to fill the word count...

Is the story unique? If it was predictable, did you enjoy
                  ...
it anyway because you like this genre/set-up?
-Not really predictable, it does take you by surprise
Do you think the art style is fitting for the story?
-Yes, somber but realistic
Were the characters well-rounded? Did they have flaws and strengths, or were they unusually strong/smart/stupid?
-Can't really comment on this. I only really focused on the MC as it was in the time I was debating whether mangas can really have a villain MC.
Did the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way?
-Realistic is a bitt much... though I could see a police case about these events showing up in the news
Do you think others will enjoy/dislike this series, even if you didn't? Why?
-A subjective work, not for everybody. I don't give the rating as to ""preach about life changing philosophies"" or anything like that. I came to research if Psychopaths can be shown well in mangas while being the MCS and that I found in plenty. 
My research ended in failure though, so who can really tell...

                I suspect that those that have gripes with the ending might have missed a big part of the theme, or maybe have been a bit too attached to the prospect of a romantic wedding ending. I read the story knowing the ending beforehand, and maybe my opinion could have been completely different had I been blind-sided. Still, I think a big part of Sachi-iro no One Room is moving on and deciding for on your own terms what happiness is for you, regardless of tragedy, loss, or abuse. 

One day, you'll find something that makes you happy, and that's still possible, for as long as
                  ...
you keep on living. I don't think the ending was necessary, but it certainly ties in with what the story had to say.

                The Nier Automata concept, it's lore, history and the depth of the characters is immense. Being retold from game form, to light novel, to anime each medium seems to have it's advantages, so I thoroughly recommend all (apart from Short Story Long)

Ideally, play the game first. The deepest meaning, the most intense battles. You feel it more. However both the LN and the anime series are great for when you have the hole left by completing the game and it's multiple endings.

Short Story Long, if I'm honest, feels superfluous and experimental. A series of short tales surrounding the main characters. They don't get enough time
                  ...
to develop before moving on.

Long Story Short and the anime version, go hand in hand. Great storytelling, cutting to the core of the game's story whilst leaning into the strengths of written and animated mediums

Mixed Feelings 





                Well, I don't know how to feel about that...
The writing here is decent, and as you'd expect from Kamachii, there's some pretty original content here, setting it apart from other works that would look ridiculous if they tried that battle bikini ""mecha outfit"" shit again.
Before I spew my hatred for certain parts, let me point out a little bit about the premise and some good philosophies!

It's the apocalypse in an age of plenty, although the premise at the beginning, resonates more like a copy of the boys, but full of ecchi and with more uninteresting characters, although with some better texts for the script


The theme
                  ...
of the ""strongest"" here is also managed for the constitution of revenge, which in reality turns out to be the main theme and the title of ""the strongest"" is just its subtext, which is ethical revenge.
The strongest system here is governed by the conspiracy system, that is, without a freedom permit, because ""Either you are the strongest governed by the rules, or you are the strongest that distorts the rules"".
Here, the work represents that distortions of rules, normally mark the end of a civilization, for the beginning of a new one governed by new distorted rules, being then polished like a crystal until they can be sold in the most beautiful ways possible, at least , so that the most unfortunate population can understand like this on top of the cloths.

-Humans are not the dinosaurs that met their fate and are no more. Let's not just tremble with fear! However pathetic, ugly, or lame it may be, we can learn from tragedy. Pain leads us to claim something greater in return! The greater the destruction you place before us, the stronger we will become! Therefore, we will not let it end with our defeat. What you brought to that boat was undoubtedly doom, but that's exactly why we have to keep going so it doesn't end there!! (Usagi Karuta)

It has also been concluded that destroying the position of the strongest for its revenge on the weak, in the end, you will only realize that the top of the world is just an easier place to be targeted when it comes to revenge. It's like a leader of a criminal faction using his own power to abuse his home, and as revenge, he decides to destroy the strongest, without thinking about what it means, destroying that podium and what from the shadows, hides an eternal cycle of revenge of subordinates, thus, the exchange of eras for the stronger (Again, this is only the first type of revenge, will be covered more ahead).

For example, Omotesandou Kyouka's words about his revenge, similar to British dinner and sweets. By themselves they were nasty and didn't sit well in her throat and seemed to hate her very soul, so she thought she'd stop before she destroyed someone, but when she realized that, much like British cuisine, she was disgusted by looking at it the wrong way. ... The desserts were made to accompany with tea and the dinners, accompanied by a beautiful whiskey.
It meant that even though she wasn't going to achieve anything and just destroy herself when she was alone, when accompanied, everything would go down so much easier and she could revel in her own madness, because the nothingness that was in her was filled by another emptiness..... And so, a certain terrorist group was born, filled with hatred for having nothing to protect (Actually, what made them different, was that they were supported by justice, thus, their ethical revenge)


And then the prophecy comes true and we meet the ""impostor"".
The scenario being then, probably about the post-revenge cycle of hate, generating more curses and no time for peace, although there is happiness and ecstasy in observing the emptiness of not achieving anything with your revenge, known also as self-affirmation of what you just lost (It is also worth mentioning that the work portrays self-destruction, but it also does not deny its reactionary revenge, like Amaashi Marika for example)

""But once they started their revenge, that's how it ended. None of your hated enemies were gone, and your good friends ended up killing each other. Guns, money and intelligence weren't the most important things in seeking revenge. Above all, you needed trust, friendship and unshakable feelings""
""Lying and empty as a shell, the imposter raised his arm, thinking he could achieve something, because even if he failed, he would still have left something behind, right? Ah... But this something, it was also revenge""
""The imposter hoped to succeed in the future, no matter what the cost, and therein lay his mistake. Not looking to the future, but looking to the past, sinking into his deep ties rather than superficial revenge.""

-That doesn't make sense, but that's okay... I never looked for that kind of reason in my revenge. Because if you decide it's not worth it, that's where the fear comes in. So I won't change what I do, goodbye (impostor)

-I'll stop you... I know it's selfish and hypocritical coming from me, but I'll stop your revenge no matter what! Before you end up like everyone else who choked on the blood of your vengeful self-mutilation! Fail your revenge and you die, but even if you succeed, what you see in front of you is all you get!!! My hands are already stained with blood, I know very well what I took from you, but for that reason, although I can't give you anything, I can stop you here and now, so that you don't lose anything else! I will end the chain of loss and violence here and now, even if I have to stoop to any level to do so!!! (Usagi Karuta)


When the title that justice wields is turned against the strongest, they are cast into their sins, and it behooves them to either accept or flee in self-assertion their lack of real strength....
The moment they realized that justice was no longer on their side, they were on the devil's path, giving up justice and understanding that it was only their group's worth, and nothing more.

When confronting the threat, it seems to behave as a kind of simulation of the theme of revenge, being mysterious for not knowing even its own feelings, confusing humans, validating its existence by continuing to consume others to achieve its revenge, and realizing that in the end , has not fought for anyone but himself, for humans themselves to realize, how little rewarding this journey is, although, it is necessary when it threatens your life and those you need to protect, thus, ready for the consequences of stealing evil and claiming justice as ""the strongest""

-Do you think every action has a purpose behind it? Human beings are full of inefficiencies. How we master these inefficiencies is what shapes our lives. Perfect efficiency would make the dullest kind of stronger imaginable. That would only lead to a dystopia... You are putting all your strength into the pointless and pointless act of revenge. You've learned everything there is to know about how we humans enjoy our inefficiencies.
 (Usagi Karuta)


""What if that was the true identity of their crystal flower? What if they were ruled by a clock like the Menace, could they still be called human? If you looked beyond the ribs and sternum, you would find the crucial component known as heart?""
""This was a battle between two different types of clock – tuning fork and crystal.""

Supported by the crystal embryo, they were different from the threat that were managed by the justice and honor of their own revenge, it was just that they were stage where there was no turning back, following only their premeditated functions, like a robot (One can see the threat as a simulator of revenge for a being that does not have a heart or is not naturally supported by the world, after all, it would then be the crystal embryo that the threat is chasing).
It's like proving that they would just rest their materials on the ground, without reflecting any crystals after they broke. On the other hand, from crystal magicians, one brings the essence of the will of the dead, not mechanically surrounded by honor, but reflected in a heart that was born of light, even if sunk underground, they were warmly close to the center of their lives (more once, crystal embryo and revenge)

When themselves, surrounded by ignorance of their existence and the trust that lay in the world, they break without understanding the path of a demon that was inherent in mistrust.
""No, maybe it was Karuta's group that was naive. The human string pullers have been waging a real war against the witches of the apocalypse since the beginning.""

Referencing the path of light that turned into flames for his mistrust, causing a cycle of hatred among his group, not attacking anyone but himself.
The witches of the apocalypse would be none other than man himself when he caused the destruction of the embryo in his despair.
""They would confess to a crime with the biggest smile on their face, not realizing that what they did was wrong""

 It is about a perception that one should trust one's friends for revenge, but never, in the world that betrayed them, even once, could it be at this very moment, that the self-mutilating despair arising from a mad conspiracy, would appear and it would devastate everything.
So when Karuta sets out to fight off all disaster in his final tournament match, it's in a dance of self-devastation, brilliantly represented in his final battle!

-Come up here. Only part of the truth can be conveyed verbally, so if you want to know more, start by clenching your fists. There is a future and a truth that we need to confirm. If the puppets stopped, the music stopped, and if the music stopped, the dancing couldn't continue, but we still have our bodies here. Our fight to the death is nothing more than a divine dance we offer to a god to get something in return... It's not about a dark revenge story! Let's just shed our bodies and tear our flesh to reach the world we want without extra worries (Pendet Denpasar)

Brought together between good and evil, ""Barond and Rangda"", these ""were not backup dancers, they were the band, an indispensable part of the musical performance, and if they were injured there would be extra worries"".
It was about forgetting all the hate for revenge and reveling in the dance that will offer your peace to your departed friends. For if there were all kinds of vengeance scattered around the world, there were also all kinds of diversions to forget about it all and create an honorable battle for your own happiness and justice.
In short, when the balance between good and evil was upset, there would be hate, and it would be up to you to remember the music of destruction and salvation that brought you here, and dance to your own tune, forgetting hate and remembering honor. , not pursuing the path of the devil, but varying between the just and the unjust through the difficulties and types of revenge that resonated through his life (In a way, although misused at the beginning for reasons that I will explain later, the path of the angel and of the devil intersect here, and from him, such an artistic dance is born)


The threat does not hate the man, it is only natural that the threat wants to learn more about the man, after all, they hate him, and nobody wants to despair to the point of not being interested in the meaning and direction of such hatred. The fact that they persecute the strongest is just also the reaction of a cycle of hatred that was difficult to define between good and evil, but very easy between allies and enemies. As also stated in the precise definition of the threat...
-The threat is nothing more than a transmitter of power in essence, so it doesn't create anything by itself, it's just the result of human feeling {hatred}. (Transline)

-Hee hee. No matter how much you celebrate your own prosperity, there is a limit that a single species can never cross. Just as a natural crystal is surprisingly fragile to external impacts!! Ah ha ha ! In that sense, I was right! I wasn't wrong!! It was the combination of carbon-based and silicon-based humans... whatever that was. They had to intentionally accept this impurity into their group to achieve this flexibility as a way of life! In moderation, even a burden or impact can trigger growth. You can't just focus on perfect cleaning in your factory needs!! Hee hee hee, gya ha!! This is the shape the future must take!!! (Transline)

 When the world's strongest denied that the threat was trying to protect them, refusing his mercy, the four celestials fought their own hypocrisy and in the end, they fell together.
If you can interpret the ""search for new forms of life"" transline, as the search for new feelings that gave meaning to life, this type of result and allocation between ""hate and love"", becomes much easier to understand. That's why it was fated for ""hate"" to overcome humanity, in an intermittent loop of self-destruction and salvation, it could be identified as the cycle of life, but if it destroyed you more than it saved, it was no different from purgatory



Because I've gone on too long already, I'll just quote not so deeply, the mystery building, strategies, world building and characters, which are definitely the worst points of the series and which throw beauty in the trash and recycle the parts they save, if making a mediocre work......

It is difficult to define a definitive value for the conspiracy of mystery and consecutively of the world, as it is a great confusion. More specifically, the world's various irregularities become conspiracy, which does not mean a lack of explanation or a freedom to plot holes, just that the answer is not certain.

The construction of mystery in this work is like breaking the basic teaching into loopholes so that they seem silly at first glance, but repair themselves over time, until they return to the shape of the original plan... This is not simply how to break the basics, and rebuild just to reach the bare minimum!? It's not a big deal, quite the contrary, it's creating stupid unhappiness and later cleaning it up with an apology. It's beating up someone on the street, then paying for your health insurance and fast food! At least, that's how I felt my IQ was treated, I felt incredibly more homo neanderthalis than I normally am! Or should I say it made me feel smarter about things even a monkey could predict? What a big shit, and as a monkey, I feel obliged to take this shit and throw it in the face of the readers of this, like in a zoo

As it is unfair to work with subjectivity, I will present more detailed examples (still, without spoilers)...
And what the hell was that ""agreement"" in volume 4? Eliminate one of the 4 celestials for another to command!? Shit, you're talking about the threat here, make 5 celestials and share the power of the world! Even with some conspiratorial excuse bullshit like ""The reserve"", it's still unacceptable how the population accepted such a factor and how Karuta could easily object to this or just say ""And who will control Aine!?"", being a pretty stupid script and forced here

Nor could I forget that cursed nuclear agreement and the strategies that were achieved.....
Invading the threat is like invading the headquarters of the main army that will protect the country. It's a little ridiculous to think that just a flashlight, some ill-considered strategies and a crystal waifu pokemon would work.
I mean, in the same way that the human learned about the threat, the threat learned about the human, but the main difference is that there was no scattered information about the threat, while the information of the crystal magicians was all over the place.
If infrared doesn't work, use natural body temperature detection to protect the interior. At least the radars and mines, even if they didn't work, it was in a fair way, albeit very long and boring.
It annoys me how everything was resolved into ""peeking"" and ""flashlight"" as if this were an assassins creed rpg game or a cheesy horror game.
And yet, even if the script uses this idiotic ""facilitation"" as a conspiratorial grind system, I won't be calling anymore until this moment comes!

Oh, and don't let me forget how easy it was for the enemies in volume 1 to track down the shards, since it was obvious who was attacking (especially when you remember that the ""enemies"" had all the information needed for a search).
Just as irritating is remembering that they were killed before they could pass their information on to the next generation, but the manner was so messy and illogical (after all, they had enough time to live for this), that it seems silly to think how many problems would have been solved. if only the script had been a little more daring to reveal the important information earlier or simply to have better organized the ""assassination"" group to prevent information from leaking out.
Shit, this conspiracy really is a mess!

At least, as a vote of confidence, there are really good twists here, like the ""impostor"" that seems like a confusing and poorly explained mystery at first, but when you realize the context, all the puns above make sense. The relationship between the threat and the space elevator was also very good, while the surprise of the ""witches of the apocalypse"" and their connection with the ""cutters"", was just as good! Oh, I can't afford to forget certain good strategies, like using the ""threat's"" design multiple times against it and plans to avoid its ""cannibalism"", which really work well


Finishing the criticism route, we have the characters......
It's 95% silly jokes and 5% serious.
The philosophy is good indeed, but there aren't enough complex or deep characters to go with it. Even Aine, which is the very concept of the crystal and the reflections that are assumed after the state of death and its connection with the clarity of the embryo, are much more script than her character, after all, she must have only 20 pages of development and the rest is the comic part of their situations, that's all...
A big mistake here is also to separate the 5 main characters, as truly they shine when they are together, and not in their uninteresting social circles! Seriously, there are only 7 good characters around here, and only one of them is a great character!


So, instead of chase revenge, we should run for the kindness of being alive, at least for Karuta, denying revenge so as not to fall further into the abyss (particularly, the character I least liked)

Marika is the one who just wants to protect her sanctuary, and doesn't mind falling into the abyss to do so, for example...
-I'm going to let the title of strongest in the world consume me, because that way I can also be overcome by the fear of losing the people important to me. No matter what, if it takes cruel action to preserve my friends' crystal, then I will destroy their flesh without hesitation (Amaashi Marika)

Kyouka is the one who accepts revenge and enjoys it corrupting her heart while her friends purify her despicable side, even in the abyss, she doesn't even care to return to the light.

The issue of the crystal embryo is probably the human kindness that is trying to overcome hatred... The fact that the world's own logic says that overcoming the threat, the simulation of hatred, was impossible, is also the reason for looking for the miracle.
Consequently, Aine behaves like the foundation, being the nucleus itself in movement that after realizing that humanity could not overcome the threat, moved towards the individual who did not make a contract with a God and could not see the meteorological lines that they traced your power before the blue sky



STORY: 6 (Good revenge story, good texts, but its construction of mysteries stinks, and as the subtlety of the mystery lies in its conspiratorial conflicts, the construction of the world, even with its poetic sense, is mediocre when considering its mistakes and gaps ....
VOLUME 1: 6.5
VOLUME 2: 7.0
VOLUME 3: 5.5
VOLUME 4: 4.5
VOLUME 5: 8.0 )
CHARACTERS: 5 (Unexpectedly, the best character wasn't Kyouka, Karuta or Marika... But Pendet Denpasar!)
FUN: 4 (It felt like reading Index's NT16 over and over again it was so boring, although I won't deny certain qualities because of that)
ART: 6 (Visually beautiful, but the base of the characters' faces is very easily distorted, in addition to not having much insight into the world itself ..... Oh, and the KING-SIZE mattress that are Aine's thighs, it's divine!)


Finally, I fall to my knees in reverence, for it certainly wasn't a waste of time and it taught me certain things I never thought of before. In clarity, I end my prayer with the question about this whole corruption story....
""After all... Did they become the strongest because they were uncommon or did they become uncommon because they were the strongest?""


EXTRA NOTE: At the end of it all, the senpai who appeared in the first volume Karuta would try to reach, disappeared with an empty trail.... Did I miss something, or was she really forgotten?

                The art is gorgeous!! The author can be a clothes designer the dresses in this manhwa are so phenomenal ✨️ Love the Fl she is one of the strongest and best Fl I have ever seen, and the true villainess (you don't see that a lot in this genre)🥺 Ml is cute too, but he really didn't stand out for me✨️

I also love the side characters.

Story is worth staying all night reading for (that's what I did). I felt like the ending was a little bit rushed and unpolished, could have been better but I did have fun reading it so I can forgive bit
                  ...
rushed ending and still give it a 10 . Side stories were interesting but not better than main story as some people say 🥰 So in summary 10/10 definitely recommend reading when you are bored.

                Jean-Louis goes about his daily life comparing people's problems to desserts in ways that feel less wholesome and more snobbish, yet somehow he draws people to him like moths to a flame. The world is his oyster, he can and does kiss any fish in the sea that catches his attention, but his one true love is chocolate and that will never change.

As the title may imply, this is a manga about a man who loves chocolate desserts and sees the world through that lens. The pages are colored in warm hues meant to call to mind the chocolate itself so the atmosphere is soft
                  ...
and welcoming, the way Jean-Louis feels when he takes a bite of something sweet. And yet, the story is more of a character study than a traditional ""put your feelings into the chocolate to make it taste better"" arc that the first chapter appeared to be setting up.

I suppose I'm grateful for that choice in direction because chapter 1 is bizarrely sexual and starts off feeling like the male characters are harassing the one female on the staff for not having a love life. The next two chapters are equally wrought with wild sexual implications and a penchant for stripping, but thankfully the story mellows out from there... chapter 4's out of pocket dentistry aside.

Between the odd but creatives metaphors, there is enough to appreciate about this manga that makes it worth a look. I'd recommend it as a short and easy read.

                I have never kept up with a manga weekly before, I would always fall behind after a couple weeks. When I found Kubo I was hooked and caught up within the first day. It was such a delight to add to my weekly Wednesday routine and I looked forward to it every week, showing up to school telling my friends about it every time. When I realized I had just read the last chapter we would get, I was genuinely in tears.

This is an incredibly heartfelt and happy manga. The story does not matter because its all about the characters. At the start when its
                  ...
just the two main characters, it does not feel boring. Enough happens between the two to keep you hooked, and their character dynamics are just perfect together. Once their friends get introduced it does not ruin the flow of the overall story, it more of a welcomed treat. This whole manga is about their quirky personalities and how they use that to have fun.

I would not have been able to tell you that I could tell it was coming to an end the last couple chapters, so the ending seemed a little abrupt. With no extra long chapter or anything like that. With that said, it was not a bad ending. It has me grinning from ear to ear. It perfectly wrapped up everything about the manga and everything that made it good into a nice ribbon.

Because this manga genuinely made me a happy when I read it and I was always smiling from ear to ear, I will consider it one of my favorite reads of all time, and I will come back to it every once in a while. I do not think I could recommend it more for a depressed teenage boy to binge read at 2 am, I wish it was there for me when I needed it.

                Kubo-san wa Mob wo Yurusanai is a romantic comedy about Shiraishi Junta, who is invisible to his classmates, has very low self-esteem, suffers from social anxiety and doesn't have any friends. One day, one of his female classmates, Kubo Nagisa who is the only person who is able to see him tries to help Junta getting friends until everyone recognizes him for 144 chapters and the reader can follow their relationship from their first interaction to confession of love. Kubo-san already has an adaptation which is unfortunately on hiatus at the time writing of this review.

In my Kubo-san anime review I had already mentioned that
                  ...
this work feels like Takagi-san Young Jump Edtition but if we compare it with Komi-san, it's much more similar to that Shounen Sunday manga's early days but its execution is much more generic. Junta looks like Tadano and has social anxiety, like Komi-san and there is a person who will help the protagonist at socializing and they are Tadano and Nagisa in their respective stories but Kubo-san takes place at an average highschool with average characters.

The biggest problem with Kubo-san is the manga doesn't have any storylines but it isn't funny at all either. It's always controversial, when a highschool story gets more serious, people consider these stories as forced drama and many school life dramas have tons of retcons. If Kubo-san doesn't have serious arcs, what do we get instead? The manga just like the anime adaptation, has a pleasant atmosphere, the characters are likeable and the facial expressions are great. On the other hand, the interractions are unfunny, repetitive and the main couple's romantic progression is really slow. Many chapter felt plastic due to its concept, where the generic romcom MC didn't even try to make friends in the first few volumes but there is no information about why Junta is invisible to others either. Nagisa will realize later on that Shiraishi is a great person but that's all you can say about him. Kubo-san is your typical female romcom protagonist, who is almost perfect but she's still more interesting due to her dissatisfaction with her own body, it's such a shame she only gets teased for it. Yeah, she has small breasts but the mangaka could have tried better. 

The art is nothing special, the frontpages of the chapters are nice, except for those monologues, which were unnecessarily melodramatic at times, the mangaka stopped writing those at some point, it was a good decision. The characters look generic, Nagisa's female family members looked like almost the same, they literrally had the same faces and the haircuts were just a little bit different. The panels often don't have background at all for pages and switching to dark background didn't work very well, because the manga is still unfunny. The art quality however improved a lot when the reader finally reaches the last couple of chapters, that's definitely a plus.

Kubo-san Won't Let Me Be Invisible is a boring romcom, which doesn't really have much to offer, it has its moments but it gets uninteresting very soon. If you are exhausted and don't know what to do, Kubo-san could be a good choice for some wholesome school life romcom, otherwise it's not worth your time and there are stories which use this formula much better.

                I thought this was nice.

The art was good. It was a much cuter style than the main storyline and other spinoffs. Lines were cleaner and thinner.

The plot and development were about average for its aim: slice of life side stories of the main cast. The plus is that the individual episodic stories were directly tied to events in the main storyline such as what the cast may have been doing a few hours later after the event, on another particular day at the location, or maybe their internal thoughts/feelings about them. I thought this was good because it added a bit more meat to each
                  ...
of the memorable parts of the main story.

The conclusion was average, but very appreciated. 

I would recommend reading this. The main storyline gets right down to business without much ""downtime"" and the spinoffs of Shield Hero all do a wonderful job in adding life to the world, its characters, and developments; this manga is one of them.

                                      (127/? chp)
                                   





                Shounen no Abyss is quite an interesting manga, and I recommend giving it a try. 

I'll try to keep this review concise, and I won't spoil anything, for the record, I'm writing this after reading the first 127 chapters. 

I think that there are two main good things about the story : 

- The story is trying to connect the dots as the chapters go on, and as a result, it's quite thrilling to discover how are some characters and events related.

- The events are rather unpredictable, meaning that it's hard as a viewer to guess how the story will go on, and it's worth
                  ...
noting for that kind of ""drama"" story. 


Regarding the things that worked a bit less ( hence the 9/10 instead of 10/10 ), two ideas come to mind : 

- It is true that some dialogues, conversations tend to feel repetitive and/or uninspired. The thing is, some characters will repeat stuff (not like in a flashback or to sum up a situation ) and after witnessing it a few times, it gets a bit boring at times, like we get it, we understand what this character feels, no need to make him say it 4 or 5 times. 

- It's similar to the other con, but some situations/events are a bit shallow, some things will be edgy for the sake of being edgy, the same goes for the frequency of sexual scenes in the frist two or three volumes. Let's say that some scenes could have been cleverer, while others could have been entirely skipped without hurting the manga. 


To sum it up, Shounen no Abyss has many qualities; and to mention it quickly, this manga's art is amazing and is a good enough reason to try reading it imo; the story is interesting enough, there is a lot of intrigue while keeping things simple. I've seen some people complain about the lack of character development and I think it might be because of the repetition thing I mentionned, nevertheless I believe many characters evolve throughout the story, aswell as the relationships that link them.

Not Recommended 





                [Tried to keep it spoiler free, though I’m not going to guarantee anything because I did use references from the story to underline what I am saying]

I didn’t get Punpun.

That is at least what I believe, I mean there must be something right? Something I missed or just didn’t understand. I mean it’s the 10th highest-rated manga on MAL so it must be good, right?
If you read this, I want you to give everything I say a critical thought for I really believe that I’m just too dumb for this. Something this universally beloved can’t be as bad as I make it out to seem.
                  ...


Art:
Punpun is all around beautifully drawn with an attention to detail, especially the backgrounds that you just don’t see in a lot of manga. This was, in my eyes, necessary to deliver the story it tells in a serious and immersive manner. Though a few of the close-up shots of the faces (of members of the Onodera family) are over the top and don’t represent the mood quite right. 

Characters: 
I once watched a youtube video that got recommended to me about some manga by Asano, Inio (the writer and artist behind Punpun) and the only thing I remember from the video was that the guy said “I’m afraid of starting to like characters in mangas by Asano because Punpun made me instinctively think that they are going to die”. 
I quite frankly don’t understand this statement. 
Firstly, while death does play a role in this story it definitely isn’t something like Game of Thrones or Chainsaw Man, Stories where you seriously don’t know who’s going to die, and in the end, the answer is most of them. This does not fit Punpun as only a few people out of the main cast die. But this isn’t really the part of the statement that I don’t get, that would be:
Secondly, the cast of Punpun is incredibly unlikeable. We will divide this into a few categories really quick:

Background characters: 
These characters are purposefully unlikeable. They are the society of Japan or the population of the world. They reflect our society and are the most obvious display of Punpuns’ underlying nihilism. This actually works really well, a bit too well even, to the point where I would literally call this manga unreadable. No, that goes a bit too far, it, of course, is readable, as I and around 150 thousand MAL users have read it all the way through. But I personally don’t get why anyone would willingly want to read this if they actually knew what it was. I’ve heard people say that this is depressing and that’s not even all that wrong, but I read this due to an immense lack of communication. You see this is depressing, like the real deal. Not what everyone says when they watch something like Clannad. Clannad is sad but it isn’t going to make you hate your life or anything. There is a huge difference between a sad story and one that is downright depressing. Reading a sad story is a kind of joy that I’m not going to begin to describe as I’m not fit to do so, to be perfectly honest. But there is no positive in being depressed. It is quite literally the essence of negativity so there isn’t anything to gain from being depressed.

Side characters:
These are mainly one-off characters and the cult, Characters that are involved in the plot but don’t have any necessary value apart from that one interaction. These one-off characters are fine and there really isn’t anything to talk about here but the cult is a whole other thing. You know what I think I’m just going to add a new category for the cult:

The cult:
The cult is a group of reappearing characters that are on their own little “adventure” and only interact with two other characters that are not important to the main events. This cult nearly made me go insane. Really, I just don’t get why this cult was even in the story, the way it appeared every now and then slowly growing in the background with a date set for the world to end was really cool. I thought this is going to be like Oddtaxi where you have these sub-stories that are going to collide and that the cult leader would, for example, win the election and riots would start or something like that. But no, the cult goes nowhere. There is absolutely no point in the story where the events of the cult become important to the main storyline.

The main characters:
I think these characters were meant to be likeable. They were (mostly) not. Punpun, the main-main-character is a whole other deal and will get his own section but when it comes to the other characters I just don’t see why I should care about them. These aren’t badly written characters, so just to make this clear I’m not saying that these characters were “bad”, what I am saying is that I didn’t care about them. There was not a single character in this story that made me think, oh I wonder what they are up to. But by far the worst they get is when Punpun and Aiko are off on their own and you get a whole chapter dedicated to what the other guys are doing. The problem was not that they were less interesting than Punpun and Aiko (though they definitely were) but that I still thought that this was going to have some grandiose ending and that they were just detracting from it. But to finally get to my biggest problem with the characters:

The Main-Main-Character:
I can’t stand Punpun and I don’t understand why you would want a character like him to be the protagonist of your story. Punpun is an aggressively dumb protagonist and maybe that’s just me overestimating how smart I am, but I don’t see myself ever acting the way he does. So, the most effective thing this character did was to make me fear that I might not know myself as well as I thought and that I might become just as dumb as the people around me. But even if that’s the case, even if that is the thing that the whole story is about, the thing I missed or didn’t get, that is still something I don’t want to be told in a way like this. I just don’t see any joy in screaming at my monitor what the hell this bird is doing right now.

Story:
This is probably not going to be all that long since this is a mainly character-driven story and thus I already said most of the things I wanted to say. 
The way I see it there are two types of stories, personal stories (like A Silent Voice, March Comes In Like A Lion or Your Name) and larger-scale epics (like Attack on Titan, Vinland Saga or Kingdom). Out of the two, this is the former though I was at least partly expecting the latter. Like I already said talking about the cult, I thought that this story would have a way larger scale than it seems but that didn’t happen. What annoys me even more than that though is that I thought it would go out with a bang, which it also didn’t. I was sure that this was going to have an unexpected big moment in the end, I was thinking of the end of Se7en and Monster, but what I got was… I’m not even really sure, I don’t really know what happened, it just did. Maybe I’m alone or the minority in thinking that the ending was disappointing, but I wanted to have something that was worth all the bullshit I endured until now. I wanted to have something that would disturb me or if the author wanted to be nice which I didn’t believe to be the case at least something like A Silent Voice. A moment that would make you think, it was all worth it but no, it just ended with an epilogue. This is fine you can add an epilogue after the climax of your story to resolve its last few plot threads, but then may I ask where was the climax? Did I just happen to skip a chapter or why didn’t I find it?

In the end, I won’t recommend this story to anyone because while I still think that it can’t be as bad as the thing I just read, that is the correct name on the cover and the characters are the same, so I’m pretty sure I did read the right thing. If you like it that’s fine, I don’t, so please at least respect that for I sure respected your opinion, questioning my own sanity before blaming the manga, what more could you wish for?

My Hero Academia is an entertaining and unique manga that offers something for everyone. The art is excellent, with unique character designs that don't go overboard like some other series. The story is engaging and has some great moments, the Paranormal Liberation War Arc is especially noteworthy, as it is where the series really takes off. 
The characters are mostly well written, though some can be a bit bland. The humor is also hit-or-miss. All in all, My Hero Academia is a great series that is worth reading.

                I wish there was more chapters :( It was such a good read! It's a really good comedy shounen-ai about working adult dudes who happen to be online friends through a gacha game but the other dude turns out to be the other dude's manager which is already funny at first lol then a lot of funny misunderstandings show up later and overall, it was such a cute and wholesome read and I definitely wanna read more between them because they are just too cuteee I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves comedy shounen-ai or just love shounen-ai in general!

                Sweet and simple and really cute up until the last chapter, which was completely heart-rending. The author even did the trope of trolling you by ostensibly ""revealing"" who won-- just to hit you with the nasty left hook (she moved on and found someone else in the end). The author executes the same kinda dynamic so much better later on when he made Blue Box, and it feels far less cheap. I still give this a 7 because it was good up until the climax for me; the last two chapters legit felt like I worked up to a confession, to get rejected and found
                  ...
out that I was led on because the girl I asked out had a boyfriend on the side. I imagine proponents for the other girl would rate this a bit higher. As for me, I'm going to bury my head in the sand and say the last chapter simply didn't happen. I'm not going to cry. I'm an adult.

                It's yuri, it's hentai... what else to say about it? Well, most importantly: the emotional tone is consistent and real to the characters, which makes the sex following their dialogs that much more realistic and, to be blunt, hot. So what suffers is the plot. Oh, it's realistic enough... it's just insanely compressed to work many lifetimes of sexual encounters into a comic that proceeds ""one chapter: one sex scene."" It's so noticeable that by chapter 13 the author jokingly compares lesbianism to a contagious disease.

It sounds artificial and trite. And the plot structure, like ""Phineas and Ferb,"" is intentionally limited to variations on a
                  ...
single plot dynamic (I won't spoil what it is). But instead of grating with repetition, the dynamic starts to amuse the reader: we see the plot machinery kick into gear and instead of crying, ""oh, no!"" we think, ""here we go again!!"" And since the emotional lives of the women are always treated sincerely and sensitively, it all works.

                This is the author's first work, and considering that, the story is really amazing. Not gonna lie, I only started reading this because I thought Harang was a cute guy. Didn't think it would lead to this lol. 

I really liked the 3 leads, they were all complex and well written including the Emperor. I think Aehwa was my favorite character throughout the entire story, while she's not necessarily relatable, she's a character that's easy to empathize with.

The story itself is around an 8/10 for me but I really liked the execution that I had to bump it up to a 9. I remember crying
                  ...
for 4 straight hours while trying to finish the story because everything was just extremely sad. 

While I loved the experience reading this, it's not something I can easily recommend since I can see the story not being the type for many.

                A startling start.
I believe that for a good mystery to be well told, the author needs to know how to ""cook"" the reader, and this manga knows perfectly well.
The beginning is impressive due to the author's ability to pace responses while adding layers of mystery.
Another important point, the art of this manga is very different and they compose very beautiful and impactful pictures.
Another merit is the ability to use cliffhangers in a way that encourages you to consume more of the story, while not getting tired due to the exhaustion of using it.
As I said, you need to know how to ""cook"" and that includes
                  ...
knowing how not to overdo it.
Finally, a really captivating suspense manga. I recommend giving it a try.

                Don't you just love it when you discover little gems when you least expect it? BL Metamorphosis is a short manga about two people bonding over a shared interest, and I'm kind of a huge sucker for stories like that. It's mainly because growing up, I didn't have a lot of friends in school because I was the weird girl who loved anime, manga, and games and wasn't interested in things my peers liked, such as gossiping about boys, makeup, fashion, and so on. Not that there's anything wrong with liking those things, mind you, they just weren't in my wheelhouse. Actually meeting people who
                  ...
shared my passion for anime/manga always made me feel like I had ascended to Nirvana, filling me with so much joy that I'd feel like I was going to explode. But now that I'm adult, that joy has quieted down a bit, but feels no less fulfilling to me, especially since I now have a lot of friends who share my interests, both IRL and online. Having just discovered this manga recently, I'm kinda surprised I didn't read BL Metamorphosis sooner, because it perfectly captures the quiet yet fulfilling joy that people get when they bond over shared interests and fandoms. If this manga had come out when I was a kid, I probably would have ate it up like a wolf.

The story goes as follows: Yuki Ichinoi is a 75-year-old widow who has been content with wiling her days away teaching calligraphy classes, doing housework, and reading. While at the bookstore, she finds herself picking up a BL manga and is strangely fascinated by what she reads. One of the clerks in said bookstore, 17-year-old high school girl Urara Sayama, notices a budding fangirl when she sees one, mainly because she herself is a fan of BL manga, especially the series that Ichinoi starts reading. Gradually, the two of them become friends over their shared love of the series, with Urara teaching her all there is to know about BL manga as a whole, even if Urara is rather shy about expressing her interest. Their newfound friendship takes them in new directions, brightening their lives and enriching their days.

For anyone worried that the BL in the title means that BL will eventually take over the story, don't worry, it doesn't go in that direction. The manga itself is pretty wholesome, and BL Metamorphosis does show some excerpts from the series that Urara and Ichinoi love, and none of said scenes contain any graphic sexual content. BL in itself is more of a catalyst than the whole purpose of the story, and the premise is flexible enough that it can work with pretty much any hobby or passion, be it gardening, architecture, motorcycles, or painting. From a technical standpoint, the artwork in general is pretty nice, and has this casual, airy quality about it, especially the linework, that captures the tranquil, ordinary beauty of the world these characters live in. The backgrounds are well rendered and the characters have down-to-earth designs that are still distinct, so you can still tell who's who a lot of the time. I also appreciate that it actually manages to make Ichinoi look her age. Most mangaka struggle with drawing old people, either making them look like tiny cartoon dwarves or just standard young people with a few stray wrinkles drawn on. Kaori Tsurutani captures all the little details that come with old age, such as the boniness of Ichinoi's fingers and the papery-ness of her skin. Even her posture and body language are good at conveying the slowness of her movement, which is hard to do.

And to nobody's surprise, Ichinoi and Urara absolutely carry the manga on their backs. The duo make such a loveable pair and it's very sweet to watch the two of them grow and change over the course of the manga, whether it be Urara learning to embrace her interests and chase her dreams without shame or Ichinoi's well-intentioned bluntness and excitement upon embracing her new hobby. I could definitely relate to Urara feeling ashamed of her hobbies and feeling ostracized because she doesn't share the same interests as her peers and finding it hard to make friends her own age. When I was a kid and getting deep into anime/manga beyond Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, I wanted to share my passions with everyone, but kids at school were either put off by it or picked on me afterward. The manga doesn't explain if Urara was bullied for her interests in the past, but it does a great job at conveying her anxiety and indecisiveness over whether she should embrace her authentic self or try to be normal, and her arc is very satisfying without taking the easy way out. Even some members of my immediate family were put off by some of the stuff I consumed, and explaining things didn't always help, so I started becoming more guarded and only shared my interests with those who already knew about it. Even most of the side characters have a surprising amount of depth and personality to them, such as the author of the manga Urara and Ichinoi like, who is surprisingly prominent. The only characters I don't have a good read on are Urara's childhood friend and his girlfriend. Their whole subplot really confused me, mainly because they don't get a lot of time to show what they're like and how or why they come to the decisions they make later on. They're not bad characters or anything, but I wish more could have been done with them and that there had been more clarity in regards to just what their deal is.

If you're someone who prefers your manga to be fast paced, action packed, and more on the loud and comedic side, you're probably not gonna like BL Metamorphosis. The manga takes pride in the fact that its a much quieter take on the premise of fandom. To quote another reviewer, so many manga about fandom are big—they focus on big emotions, big events, on collection and consumption. There's nothing inherently wrong with that if the execution is done well, but I wish more took the route BL Metamorphosis does, on how fandom can sometimes be the simple pleasure of meeting others who share an interest and turning that into friendship. It helps that the manga is pretty short and sweet, complete at 5 volumes, though I kind of wish it had been a bit longer so it could have explored some more things, like Urara's past, more of her male childhood friend, or even what Ichinoi was like back when she was younger and growing up when manga was making waves. That would have been an interesting angle. But nevertheless, I'm happy with BL Metamorphosis as it is. It's a sweet, wholesome, laid-back manga about two people from different points in life bonding over a new hobby and forging a friendship over it, and you know I'm always a sucker for those kinds of stories. And knowing that there's a live-action movie based on this, I kind of want to track it down and watch it. Hey Netflix! Care to stream that?

                                      (71/110 chp)
                                   





                Warning contains spoiler in the middle section!!!
Story 4/10
Artwork 8/10
Characters 5/10

When starting to read the manga it gives someone the idea that the plot is going to follow the following plot points:

-Girl get brutally inserted to a death game,
-The mob character she meets is very strong,
-They work together to win the game, while falling in love in each other
...

But when reading the manga further most people would have realised at this point that those are only some dreamy thoughts of a naive reader, because the story goes into some completely different direction.

(Spoiler warning!!!)


-The ML is some kind of twisted psychopath that craws for affection no matter what, because while reading, it shows that this guy is a control freak, insufferable for everybody involved (even the reader) and seem to cannot learn from anything.
And even his background story is fucked up because it showed that even as a kid, he craved for so much affection, that he manipulates everybody (even the viewer) for receiving even a little bit of affection.
-The FL let this psychopathic guy do everything to her and while forgiving him, while showing that she hates humanity for treading everybody like objects.
-The side characters can be listed in the following basic categories: The siscon, the similar like the FL innocent sister, the sadist girl and the masochist (He almost never speaks, but is most of the time around)

Before speaking further, we need to discuss the game they playing, it's a game where magical girl like people fight each other, while being controlled by a their partner, they alone can't do nothing and need to rely on their partner. Everybody has 3 lives after finishing the tutorial stage and need to fight in PvP battles to reach higher rank from F to SS, in SS rank they won the game and are free.

This cast is meeting each other after their fight with the main girl and guy, the main guy is outsmarting everyone what results to them winning every battle. This results to some tension between the main guy and the sadist girl, after they fought and after that teamed up with each other, what climaxed to the traumatisation of the sadist girl, trough torturing her, this results ultimately to even a greater splitting of the already very instable team.

And the FL? The main girl is playing the main guys puppet the whole time, not even thinking of revenge, while he abuses her sexually.


(Spoiler end)

(Personal opinion)
All in all, this manga is the first manga that ever awoken the emotion of being so disgusted of a character (ML), that it takes me here to write a review, because if this is the goal of the author, he done it great, because I'm disgusted.
This resulted that the even reading to chapter 71 was a chore that I don't want to repeat twice.

Tbh, the artwork is great and that is the main reason why I read this in the first place, but the abusive nature of everything in this manga drove me to dropping this manga and wanting me to go to the holy farther to confess my sins.

(Hope ya like ma first and prop. last review ever)

                This is one of the best Hentai out there. Basically it is Persona but porn, with the group of thieves and all. Except that fuck them ""anime highschoolers"" trope of other millions of anime, we are talking about fucking ADULT teachers, fucking other adults.

""Plot"" 🍆 🍑 💦
You have a famous thief with horny assistants who are into some BDSM stuff, stealing some historically valuable items while being fabulous. They lead normal life personas as college and highschool teachers. You would have the generic dense harem protagonist but the girls push him to being a Gigachad. Also he has a cool long hair that is different
                  ...
from other generic dense harem protagonists you seen in million of anime and games.

The author even adds some romance and character development.

What you can expect:
*The dude actualy bangs the girls
*There is romance too
*No NTR, one creepy dude attempts it but that's all
*BDSM but very light hearted in general
*Dumb fun and hilarious at times.
*The art even though simple is very decent in comparison to most shonen harem BS, each character has an unique design and the artist has a taste for fashion, the aesthetics are very thoughtful for an erotic story.

                                      (148/? chp)
                                   





                The art is very good, it's nothing amazing, but it's very clear and generally pleasant, unless we see a side shot of the face of any character in which case, it looks horrendous. The art is very consistent, until one point, which is the only time we really get a major change in the style, chapter 130-131, the fact it comes in so late makes the change so much more meaningful and gives the events that relate to it so much more power, it is amazing.

Okay, the 10 first chapters are just perfect. It is so funny, the characters are so intriguing, every new unlock
                  ...
is stupider than the last, the plot is so ridiculous, the way the fights are structured with an ""information gathering"" phase and then the actual fights is fascinating, the pacing's great. If the manga was just that, it would easily be a high 8.
After that, once Andy and Fuuko join the Union, it slows down for a bit and the more serious story starts to take its place while the jokes take a backseat (though the ones we get remain very funny) and we get a second introduction of sorts, it's still good, just not as good in my opinion as the first 10 chapters and that applies for the rest of the manga I think. 

However, we do start getting more characters, which are all absolutely amazing, their designs are each super great and distinct, their personalities are all very interesting. This truly applies to every character, including characters like Rip or Top who present archetypes I usually hate, or Creed who is unbelievably simple, yet still super interesting.
If this manga was nothing but the story of each of the character's backstory, it would be a 10/10, their stories are just this interesting and present such emotionally powerful scenes, I just want to learn more about them, all their misfortunes are so unique! Every time the story goes back to a misfortune that has already been presented to add detail unto it, it feels great. Every character interaction is just a joy to read.

The action scenes are good, but I personally feel that action scenes in general have a sort of hard cap on how good they can be without being animated (for instance Demon Slayer or Mob Psycho II) or being absolutely insane (Chainsaw Man or Goblin Slayer), since the Unluck Undead manga offers neither (until the God fight when Undecrease comes into play, HOLY SHIT, just thinking about it puts a smile on my face), they are good, but nothing more really. However, the non-conventional fight scenes like the fight against Spring are very good (but not amazing).

The setting is underdeveloped I think. We barely see any interactions with Apocalypse or any explanations relating to his rules, we don't see many artifacts and see even less of them being explained, Umas are explained in a way that doesn't make sense if we take into account what rule they are supposed to represent and how the world was before their existence, some rules seem to exist before their Umas do (Insect for instance (if we compare the 101th's loop's earth to the one where Insect was killed)), some Umas have rules that make no sense (Move or ""Kain"" for instance), some Umas seem to exist without Apocalypse, etc. The one chance we had to see a lot of Apocalypse is used to skip 26 years, there's so many little holes that feel like they could easily be patched up if the author just took the time to explain them properly. 

This leads me to my next point, negators are a mixed bag, most of them are pretty self-explanatory, like Unluck negating luck, Undead being unable to become dead, Undecrease being unable to run out of things, Unrepair making things impossible to fix, but others feel a little wonky like Untruth making people do the opposite of what they want (the part about them saying the opposite makes sense though), Unfair... just... I get it, but... why? Unruin and Unfade also make very little sense. That's not to say negators aren't great, most of their abilities are really interesting, but some others feel out of place like Umas.

The pacing is pretty bad honestly, it gets better during the 101th loop, but the problem is that the story seems to be too focused on doing 1 thing at a time, so we'll get 10 or more high speed, combat focused chapters before 5 or 6 slower chapters, but the fact that they are often so grouped up makes it so that the highs don't feel like highs (cough cough Spoil fight cough cough), because they are surrounded by other highs, and the lows don't feel like lows, because they are surrounded by other lows. It's a lot better when it mixes it up like during the Autumn fight or while Fuuko is looking for other negators.

The 101th loop is just god tier, the time skip feels like a huge shame, because it's more of my biggest problem with this manga, we don't see enough of the small things (artifacts, Umas and the world in general outside the main plot) to truly be able to appreciate the world, but what we do get is taking what the 100th loop did well and polishing it until no impurities remain, we don't just see the flashbacks about the misfortunes that every negator has, we see the misfortunes take place, it's so good. We get to learn about the characters we couldn't learn about in the previous loop, every little spec of information from the first part comes back into play, it's just amazing.

It's a mid 8. Because of the terrible pacing, while reading it, I was thinking more of giving it a high 7 or low 8, however, thinking back on it, it has so many memorable moments and such a powerful and interesting plot, I just can't give it any lower than a mid 8.

                After seeing that quite a lot of fellow readers have already written its review, I was doubting whether I should also participate in this race? Then I thought, does it really matter if I write one or not? It's not like anyone going to notice this in the heap of ""great"" and ""popular"" reviews. So, let's begin it...

It was quite hell of a ride for me, personally. You may ask, why? Because my friend, I have a soft spot for slice of life manga whether it is shoujo or josei or shounen in a broader terms. And this manga has somewhat of everything in it.
                  ...
It has a little bit sci-fi (mostly coding related which I somewhat understood >_<), a little bit of slice of life, a little bit of shoujo (well, most of the times, it was a parody of shoujo...I will explain it in later part), a little bit of age-gap (age-gap of 8 years...uh-huh, my parents have 7-years of age-gap between them o_o) and lots of learning for a lifetime, at least for me personally.

Now, I'm going to talk about its each ingredient in detail. So bear with me... >_<
This manga is full of coding jargon...I wish I had an engineering or science background to tell whatever was written in the story if it was correct? But who cares, right? As long as it is not complicating the story or making it blend, it is alright. Well, this is the exact case with Dengeki Daisy. The science fiction parts doesn't hinder the story at all. The story moves at its own pace. You won't be rushed here. So, read it with a patient and calm mind. Okay? ^_^
Coming onto the shoujo aspect of it...I think it is quite different, in a good way, from you ideal shoujo manga. Here, the each character act as you and me. It means they are imperfect (mostly) and perfect (rarely) in their own way. They have their shortcomings and downfalls as well as they have their strengths. No one is ideal here. They make you realize that there is no ideal way to convey your feelings to your beloved ones...like there is no ideal way write down this review ^O^. Each character has their grey moments in the story. So, if you're someone who is idealistic shoujo manga reader, beware!!! because some moments or characters will repel you keep reading it. Please start it with open-mindedness >_<!
Talking about its art-style, I would say I'm not qualified enough to pass my judgement on art-style. For me, personally, I feel it is drawn with mangaka's sweat and tears (I mean hard work :D) and I don't want to disrespect her work by giving my opinions naively. Honestly, I appreciate her time, effort and hard work that she had put into creating it.

Lastly, I would just say that if you're considering to give it a try then sure, go ahead but with open-mindedness. Thank you for patience with me and being with me till here. See you in new story. Until then, take care! \_^o^_/

Last minute edit - Akira is my favourite one in this. I just loved his character. I still don't know why though! ~_~

                I didn't expect much from a 5 chapter manga but the MCs quickly won me over. They both were not the type of characters I expected and their straightforwardness and lack of over-dramatic cold behaviour towards each other or lack of rivalry was also very nice.
The first 3 chapters and the bonus slice of life moments are highly recommended.
Overall it's a good manga. Not the greatest out there but one of the better ones. Especially considering how many mangas end up with the MCs having non-consensual or dub-con ""making love"".
No such thing here.
Both love each other and meet naturally from eating each others sweets and
                  ...
then confessing feelings properly before diving into a stable relationship.
I just wish there was more. I would love to just read their daily lives and how they influence each other both personally and work wise.

Mixed Feelings 





                I've heard of people looking like their pets, but have you ever fallen in love with someone because THEY look like your beloved pet? Me neither.

Weekend Citron is an interesting BL that tries very hard to be sweet, but kind of forgets to build up much of a relationship between the characters beyond ""oh, he's pretty"" and ""oh, he looks like my dog and lets me pet his hair"", which is unfortunate because there is a lot of potential here. A pâtissier whose passion for baking comes from his connection to his grandmother, ultimately evolving into the only method he had for communicating with the
                  ...
world outside of his small familial bubble, is a fantastic concept that isn't explored deeply enough. In part, the short length of the series hinders a lot of that development, so it's only expected that certain aspects would fall to the wayside in favor of pushing the main leads together as quickly as possible. Not even acknowledging the fact that we know nothing about his love interest, there are unfortunately other problems that develop from this lack of in-depth characterization.

Jin's sad backstory explains why he is so closed off and awkward around others, but the story seems to almost infantilize him in the process. This becomes a problem during two scenes: one in which he is kissed without consent while passed out drunk and another in which our eyes are jumpscared with surprise smut.

At the very least, that kiss does get addressed as a wrong that has been committed... but the writing gives off the distinct impression that we, as readers, should be romanticizing Souichi's constant guilt over it. This all comes to a head during the chapter 4 smut scene where he starts seeing Jin as someone too pure and innocent for first kisses and sex. And yet, that doesn't stop him from forcing himself on Jin even though Jin tells him to stop. This still isn't the worst non-con I've seen from a BL, but it was definitely an uncomfortable escalation from the very sweet buildup to that moment.

The bonus chapter is a welcome breath of fresh air that introduces how the relationship between Ai and Makoto developed through the years. Unfortunately, it brings out the ""remove glasses, braces, and baby fat to become hot"" trope, which has become so old and worn by this point that all I can muster is a disappointed sigh in response. Other than that, it's cute and I wish I could have seen more of them being adorable together!

Overall, there are some really great moments in between the scenes that leave a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, chapter 4 can't just be skipped if you want to understand some important details from Jin's backstory, so brace yourself for the uncomfortable smut or commit yourself to skimming it like I did if the rest of the manga's concept intrigues you. Thankfully, the smut section is short enough.

                To start off, I don’t understand why people are so overly critical about this manga. Yes it’s super hyped, but comparing it to other SJ I feel like it’s done it’s job extremely well! Like honestly so many more issues with one piece in terms of art, characters, story, etc.

Plot 8.5/10
IMO naruto has a great world space, that is clearly the best to do the ninja genre on a large scale. The plot follows growth patterns that make sense, good pacing and overall easy concept of confronting hate/ conflict in the shinobi era. 

Characters 9/10
characters built on reasonably power scaling methods that feel unique and
                  ...
not like every character is super OP. Chakra to me seems to be one of the best power concepts in anime. Most of the characters are compelling and dynamic. Yes some of the later villain stuff seems rushed/forced but think of it to progress the plot to where it needs to be and for me it was fine. Yes Sakura is kinda of mediocre. Take in the different styles and affinity that let every character perform entirely unique jutsu.

Art 8.5/10
Nothing much to be said here, it’s not vagabond or berserk, it’s nice aesthetic without to much over saturation and the consistency remains at a high quality SJ.

Overall :

Naruto being so large scale with a large cast of characters; people tend to be extremely over critical of it. I think naruto can create a super impactful experience for anybody ! I’ll give it a 10 for the sake of what it accomplished for the genre, realistically it’s probably a 9.

""The artwork in Vagabond is simply stunning. Inoue’s art style is incredibly detailed and realistic, and he does an amazing job of conveying the atmosphere of the Sengoku period. The characters are all well-defined and distinct, and the action scenes are incredibly dynamic and exciting. Inoue’s use of light and shadow is also masterful, and he does an excellent job of conveying the emotions of the characters.

The characters in Vagabond are all incredibly well-developed and likable. Musashi is a complex and fascinating protagonist, and his journey to become the greatest

                Fans of Chainsaw Man and Fire Punch will immediately recognize the same author, if indeed that isn't the reason you came here to begin with. Whether that is the reason or not, this one-shot is definitely worth reading if you have an hour or two to spare and enjoy a little slice of life.

For people that are familiar with Chainsaw Man or Fire Punch (and I promise to stop referencing them after this) you will see the same sort of style in this manga. I don't just mean the art, but also the author's tendency to have a scene show large progressions of time with
                  ...
very little movement, and then to have equally large momentous plot lines get delivered with shocking realism and a sober sense of clarity. Aside from one brief moment later in the manga, most of this is shockingly real to life and leaves you questioning things about yourself that you identify in the characters. 

Since the story is so short and sweet I won't give any details regarding it, except that it's a sort of coming-of-age/romance between two very different people who find that they aren't so different after all. My biggest complaint about this manga is that I felt the plot took an unexpected turn that didn't really feel earned and didn't land with the impact that it could've in a serialized manga. The plot turn later on is very interesting and meaningful, I  just feel like it was so out-of-place and sudden that the emotional impact was replaced with mild confusion. 

Otherwise definitely worth a read.

                Nooooo.. Why is it have to end. I want moreeee. i want some more tensai Sakuragi, more rukawa, and basically anything or everything. But Shohoku vs Sannoh is just peak match. The art is amazing, you can see the big improvement in the art. This is just amazing and i read it all in 2-3 days because of how good it is. Tensai Sakuragi is just a GOATED character. I dont want it to end, but this is Takehiko Inoue we're talking about, an artist that known for the man who never finished his art. But overall i super enjoyed it and i think this
                  ...
is one of the best sports manga i've ever read.

Ashita Tenki ni Naare
(Manga)

Recommended 





                Ashita Tenki ni Naare is a long-running sports manga by well-known mangaka Chiba Tetsuya, and it is one of the most well-known golf manga. The main character is a student named Mukai Taiyou, who comes from a family that lacks financial freedoms, with the only adult being his mother who runs a restaurant, where the family resides on the second floor. As a result, Mukai shows great interest in earning money, and grabs any chance that presents itself, like asking his fellow classmates to be paid in return for certain tasks, such as predicting what will be in the next test. His ultimate goal, however,
                  ...
is to become a pro golfer, and be able to financially support his family. For this, he works part-time at a golf course, as well as being steadily taught by a former pro golfer on the side. As evident from these descriptions, Mukai is a hard-working, honest individual, but his greatest asset is his natural aptitude for the sport.

Chiba’s manga often portray those with a specific, extraordinary skill in the ordinary everyday; ones who can persevere through any hardships life may throw their way, from Yuki no Taiyou to Ashita no Joe. Taiyou is no different, able to overcome any obstacle in his path through perseverance, and much like the protagonists of Chiba’s other sports manga, he shows a natural adeptness to golf, and is very quickly able to show a level of skill that surpasses veterans much more seasoned to him.

There are many similarities that can be drawn between Taiyou as a character, to Teppei from Ore no Teppei, one of Chiba’s other sports manga. They are both rash, inexperienced, and quick to anger; but also quite clever, with a great amount of natural talent. Obviously, there are also differences, particularly with Taiyou being not quite as quick-witted as Teppei. Teppei, comparatively, can also be much more obnoxious and sneaky, whereas Taiyou generally doesn’t try to outwit his opponents through various methods, unless they attempt to outwit him first. One of the scenes in the manga shows this trait; during one of the competitions, when one of the other players attempts to thwart Taiyou’s play through dishonest conduct. Once Taiyou realizes this, he decides to reverse the situation, putting the pressure on that player, but through fully honest conduct, which eventually leads the other player to be unable to overcome that pressure instead.

There are a range of competitions shown in the manga, from a national golf competition for students, to The Open, one of the most revered golf competitions in the world. Present also are many real-life professional golf players from the period this manga was running; the most notable member of this lineup probably being Jack Nicklaus, generally considered to be among the greatest players in golf history. Though I am unfamiliar with pro golf, and these players are all before my time, for those who are knowledgeable, it would be amusing to see this kid beat out some of the greatest golf players in history.

The increase in scale of the competitions stands in contrast to Ore wa Teppei, where, though the competitions and opponents do gradually increase in skill, they are always national competitions, with the opponents always students. The increase in scale here is more comparable to Ashita no Joe, which also sees international opponents later on. However, Joe is older than Taiyou, and therefore the opponents, who are mostly all adults, feel that much more daunting here. Combined with Taiyou’s small stature (even the opponents often remark on the surprise they feel that such a small person is able to exert so much power), it makes his achievements seem all the more impressive.

Chiba’s art here is some of the best he’s ever drawn, and every golf match is presented with great intensity, and in such a way that is best conveyed as a comic. The ‘grittiness’ of Chiba’s art brings the characters, as well as the aesthetic of 1980s Japan, the central setting, to life, and his grounded yet stylized art allows for the golf courses to be presented to the reader with the feeling of magnificence they deserve. This is also achieved by a large helping of double page spreads throughout all the golf competitions, which overall, number much more compared to some of his other sports manga. The general visual presentation of the manga is also nothing short of impressive, with the powerful swings of the players being shown in all their double spread glory, and numerous smaller vertical panels being used when necessary, such as when a golf ball is shown falling from the sky, becoming gradually more visible in successive small panels as it falls, giving the ball a feeling of movement and speed it would otherwise lack.

The greatest shortcoming of the manga is that the side characters, particularly Taiyou’s mentor, Ryukoku, as well as his friend Etsuko, are largely thrown by the wayside in the latter half of the manga. This is disappointing as in Ashita no Joe or Ore wa Teppei, many of the side characters throughout the manga become interesting characters in their own right. There is the impression that, at least with Ryukoku, there may have been plans to give him his own backstory and character arc, what with his distinct appearance, combined with the mention that he was a pro himself back in the day, but this never comes to fruition. In addition, Taiyou’s family are never made to be particularly interesting characters in their own right, which is a shame considering that in Ore wa Teppei, Teppei’s father was an interesting and entertaining character in his own right. Apart from Taiyou and the other pro players, the most interesting characters are probably the caddies, of which most have colorful personalities, but they change every course, and never appear again afterwards, which can’t help but feel a little unfortunate.

Ashita Tenki ni Naare may not feature the distinctly memorable moments featured in some of Chiba’s other manga, and the lack of any notably interesting side characters will always feel like a bit of a missed opportunity. Still, for a work featuring a static sport portrayed in a static medium to be this engaging is certainly a commendable feat, and Chiba’s art and overall skill as a mangaka elevate the manga far above what it could have been otherwise. It's an enjoyable comic on its own, and also a great display of some of Chiba’s skillfulness as a mangaka. It also features a charismatic lead, whose development as a person and as a player is more than enough to make this manga worth reading.

                A  interesting premise, but unfortunately, it fell short in execution. The art was decent, but the story lacked depth and interest. It had a lot of potential but failed to deliver on it.

The main character's backstory and motives were unclear, making it difficult to connect with him or care about his actions. The plot was predictable, and the pacing was slow, making it a tedious read. The supporting characters were underdeveloped, and their actions felt forced and unnatural.

Overall, the manhwa had a lot of potential with its secret society and multiple aliases, but it failed to deliver on it. I wouldn't recommend it to
                  ...
anyone looking for a captivating and thought-provoking read.

                ""Dungeons & Artifacts"" is an exciting and engaging manhwa that offers a unique take on the dungeon-crawling genre. The story follows the adventurer Stetch Atelier, who is betrayed by a prince during a dungeon-guiding gig and is cursed to die. However, Stetch is resurrected by a sentient artifact that offers him a deal to get his revenge. To hold up his end of the bargain, Stetch embarks on a journey of raiding dungeons, slaying monsters, and making new enemies and friends along the way.

The story is well-crafted and the pacing is spot on, keeping readers engaged from start to finish. The characters are also well-written,
                  ...
with each having their own distinct backstory and motivations. The world-building is also top-notch, with a fantasy land setting that includes human kingdoms, elves, and dwarves, as well as dungeons filled with monsters and artifacts.

The standout feature of ""Dungeons & Artifacts"" is the execution of the plot. While the basic premise may seem similar to other stories in the genre, the author has done an extraordinary job at bringing their own unique twist to the story. The action scenes are consistent and amazing, with the artwork bringing them to life in a way that is both visually stunning and easy to follow.

Overall, I would highly recommend ""Dungeons & Artifacts"" to fans of fantasy and action manhwas. It's a well-crafted and engaging story with top-notch artwork and characters that will keep readers hooked from beginning to end. If you're looking for a unique take on the dungeon-crawling genre, this is definitely a manhwa to check out.

                Overall, I found ""My Gift LVL 9999 Unlimited Gacha"" to be an enjoyable and engaging manhwa. The story and characters are well-developed, with plenty of action and adventure to keep readers hooked. The concept of gaining powers through a gacha system is an interesting twist on the typical superhero origin story, and it's executed well in the manhwa. The author does a great job of building a world that is both familiar and unique, with a blend of real-life and fantastical elements that create a compelling setting for the story.

The artwork is also a standout feature of the manhwa. The illustrations are detailed and dynamic,

One thing that particularly stood out to me about the manhwa was the pacing. The story moves at a brisk pace, with plenty of action and plot twists to keep readers on their toes. Despite the fast-paced nature of the story, however, the author still manages to develop the characters and world in a way that feels organic and satisfying.

Overall, I would highly recommend ""My Gift LVL 9999 Unlimited Gacha"" to fans of action and fantasy comics. It's a well-crafted and engaging story that offers a unique take on the superhero genre, with top-notch artwork and engaging characters that will keep readers hooked from beginning to end.

                This is a cute and short story.

You'd think you understand where the story is headed given the premise, but I enjoyed how the author subverted my expectations. Well, I say I enjoyed it but it was more like shock and sadness. The conclusion raises some questions for me, but I don't think they're ever directly confirmed.

I did enjoy the contrast in personalities between the MC and FMC. Perhaps I'm dense, but I still don't understand why FMC puts so much effort into her relationship with the miserable bastard that is the MC. Still, I don't necessarily dislike miserable, self-loathing MC's. Logically it also doesn't track
                  ...
why FMC doesn't tell her friend about her condition, but I guess the allure of the story is that MC and her have a special relationship.

                If your favourite part of Evangelion was the religious imagery and lore, then you're in luck, because Anima certainly delivers in that aspect. Due to being in a novel format, Anima has the freedom to have lots of intriguing ideas that an anime wouldn't have the time to flesh out. The lore and mysteries of the original series (such as what exactly SEELE is) are expanded on in a way that feels consistent with Evangelion as a whole. The Christian references are more involved, prominent, and meaningful (though still fairly aesthetic and surface-level), and the global impact of the events is explored -- something the
                  ...
original series merely alluded to. As is the case with the Rebuilds, the psychological drama and existential angst of the original series are toned down in Anima, which works in Anima's favour because there can be a greater focus on action and lore. The ending is not all-out happy (after all, this is Evangelion), but it's not depressing and dark either. A bigger issue is that the ending feels rushed, and there's very little payoff (of any kind) and catharsis for the reader, which furthers the point that Anima is meant to be read for more Evangelion action and lore -- and more of that is never a bad thing.

If you love Evangelion and want more Evangelion between the manga, original series, and Rebuilds, Anima fills this niche. It feels like a natural extension of the original series and Rebuilds, which makes it all the more enjoyable.

These series are two very different genres but are similar in the facts that:
- They are both a wholesome family-centered manga
- They both have a cute young girl as one of the main characters, one who wants to help her parents, but is still a child with childish thoughts
- They both have a slightly inexperienced, slightly panicked father figure who is good at cooking
- They both have a nervous female character who may or may not have a crush on the father figure (with the exception that one of them is afraid of knives and the other is a secret assassin... and that one can cook great meals and the other can cook... accidental poison. Anyway.) reportManga rec by hazelnut000 - Yesterday, 9:54 PM

- Both webtoons are based on bromance novels by the same author, Taesun.
- Both webtoons are illustrated by yaoi artists: ""Doctor's Rebirth"" is illustrated by artist Dobin (""Master? Master!"") and ""Dusk Howler"" is illustrated by artist Nansae (""The Master's Appetite"").
- Both stories revolve around a bromance relationship between a teacher, a pupil and some third guy.
- All three main characters are androgynous bishounens.
- There are a few more bishounens in the story.

The novels ""Dusk Howler"" (shounen, bromance, VRMMORPG) and ""Doctor's Rebirth"" (shounen, bromance, isekai, medical) are the only Taesun's novels where the events take place in the ""murim"" (the ""ancient Chinese"" martial arts world). The novel ""Dusk Howler"" consists of two parts: the first part tells about the first server (the ""European"" world of sword and sorcery), while the second part tells about the second server (the ""ancient Chinese"" martial arts world), however, in the manhwa ""Dusk Howler"", there is only the ""European"" server because the novel ""Dusk Howler"" consists of about 12 volumes, but the manhwa ""Dusk Howler"" showed only the events from the first two volumes of the novel.

In the other novels by Taesun, events take place in the ""European"" world of sword and sorcery: ""Game Master Mion"" (shounen, VRMMORPG), ""Dynamite"" (shounen, romance, music, VRMMORPG), ""Thanatos"" (shounen, VRMMORPG), ""Deadline of Silver"" (shounen, fantasy, vampires), ""The Phantom Master"" (shounen, romance, fantasy, isekai), ""The Dragon Master"" (josei (where the protagonist is an asexual teenage boy who pretends to be a magical girl, and his love interest is a heterosexual teenage boy who is unrequitedly in love with this magical girl), magical academy, fantasy, post-apocalyptic), ""Master of the Divine Beasts"" (shoujo, romance, reverse harem, fantasy), ""Chitra"" (shoujo, romance, reverse harem, fantasy, isekai, game system). reportManga rec by Nancy_Drew - Yesterday, 9:10 PM

Lonely Girl ni Sakaraenai is the PG-13 high school counterpart to the R-rated adult life manga Ichido dake demo, koukai shitemasu.

I strongly recommend both as must-read yuri manga, if you can look past the initially off-putting noncon setting. reportManga rec by erkin - Mar 2, 2023

Dusk Howler
add



""The Founder of Diabolism"" and ""Dusk Howler"" are mysterious action stories where several clans or guilds hunt undead, ghosts, demons, etc., but ""The Founder of Diabolism"" is a BL story that tells about a romantic relationship between the two bishounens, while ""Dusk Howler"" is a shounen story with BL subtext that tells about a bromance relationship between the three bishounens. 

Both stories are adaptations of the novels of the same name. Both the novel and the manhua ""The Founder of Diabolism"" take place in the ""ancient Chinese"" world where people learn martial arts to achieve immortality. Both the novel and the manhwa ""Dusk Howler"" take place mainly in the virtual MMORPG game ""Trikia"" and sometimes in modern South Korea. The first part of the novel ""Dusk Howler"" tells about the first server (the ""European"" world of sword and sorcery), while the second part tells about the second server (the ""ancient Chinese"" non-magical martial arts world), however, in the manhwa ""Dusk Howler"", there is only the ""European"" server because the novel ""Dusk Howler"" consists of about 12 volumes, but the manhwa ""Dusk Howler"" showed only the events from the first two volumes of the novel.

Nine, the deuteragonist in ""Dusk Howler"", is a romantic, eccentric and childish undead / necromancer who is similar to Wei Wuxian, the protagonist in ""The Founder of Diabolism"", while Mori, the tritagonist in ""Dusk Howler"", is a cold, strict and caring dark elf / swordsman who is similar to Lan Wangji, the deuteragonist in ""The Founder of Diabolism"".  

Nine and Mori are best friends who have been living together in a private home and acting like a loving married couple for several years, but they often quarrel and fight because Nine is a sexual pervert who likes to do indecent deeds, while Mori is an asexual tsundere who gets angry every time Nine behaves in an indecent manner. But the plot of ""Dusk Howler"" mainly revolves around the bromance relationship between Nine and the protagonist Jaiha and pays little attention to the bromance relationship between Nine and Mori. Jaiha is a shy, modest and hardworking human / wizard who agreed to become Nine's pupil because Nine promised that he would turn Jaiha from a pathetic loser into a great man.   

Both Wei Wuxian (the founder of Demonic Cultivation) and Nine (a.k.a. Chaos Lord, Dark Tower Master, etc.) are sweet and friendly jokers, but they have a reputation for being great and terrible villains because they have a huge power and regularly perform ambiguous actions. However, Wei Wuxian follows the path of a hero and does predominantly good deeds, while Nine follows the path of a villain and does predominantly evil deeds. reportManga rec by Nancy_Drew - Feb 28, 2023

It's like an immovable object versus an unstoppable force, but if the object was an incel puppet master with a dog and the force was a Cambridge University professor with 12 PhDs and the head of a chicken.

Then there's all the adventure elemtents, too. Lastly, the power-systems as-well, to a small degree.

The titular Roxana and Medea from Your Throne are even similar characters, though Medea has the other female lead of Your Throne to balance her out, and thus is working on gaining more compassion and empathy.

Both series have these women scheming against their corrupt families that traumatized them, though in Your Throne the scheming is primarily focused on the Emperor. Both series are primarily psychological crime/revenge stories set in the typical fantasy manhwa setting. reportManga rec by CourtRoseFaerie - Feb 22, 2023

Heroine Hajimemashita.
add



Mizutama Honey Boy and Heroine For Hire have the same set-up with the strong girl and the princess-y boy. However, Mizutama Honey Boy is more comedic and leans into the characters being gender non-conforming, while Heroine For Hire feels more along the lines of your average shoujo romance with the dynamics.

If you liked
Fruits Basket
add








...then you might like
Kitchen no Ohimesama
add



Both series begin as lighthearted romantic comedies where our kindhearted protagonist gets mixed up with a pair of wealthy boys who are related to each other. You can easily compare Najika and Tohru's never ending kindness, compassion, and optimism, even though Najika has more grit. Sora and Yuki are both princely characters, and Kyo and Daichi are both the rougher outcasts.

Both series do delve into darker subjects, such as grief and parental abuse/neglect and deal with these topics in a sensitive manner. Kitchen Princess is for a younger audience than Fruits Basket, though. Also, both series do have a strong focus on character development where all the characters strive to be better people. reportManga rec by CourtRoseFaerie - Feb 22, 2023

Tensei Ningyohime wa Awa ni Natte Kietakunai
add



Both series have influences from the Little Mermaid story by Hans Christian Andersen, and both of them have isekai elements. The only difference is one is reincarnation and the other one involves being transported to another world.

Both series also have Rei Touma doing the artwork, though she's also the author for The Water Dragon's Bride. reportManga rec by CourtRoseFaerie - Feb 21, 2023

...then you might like
Code Name wa Sailor V
add



Both series are spin-offs of a major magical girl series and primarily feature a monster of the week theme before entering a main conflict. They both focus on a specific magical girl instead of a team like their parent series. In the case of Sailor V it's the preexisting Sailor Venus, while in a La Mode it's the new character of Berry Shirayuki.

Code Name Sailor V was conceptualized before Sailor Moon began and as a result feels more tight, especially since it's a prequel, while Tokyo Mew Mew a La Mode was a sequel. reportManga rec by CourtRoseFaerie - Feb 21, 2023

Fruits Basket
add



The end of The Gentlemen's Cross Alliance was very similar to Fruits Basket with the themes of abuse and the treatment of the body doubles was very similar to how the Zodiacs, particularly the cat, in  Fruits Basket were treated. There are even characters who mirror Shigure and Akito from Fruits Basket.

Both series contain a lot of drama, comedy, and heavy themes. There is also a love triangle in both, and there's a wide variety of chaotic side characters. Both series also include wealthy families with complex politics, age gaps, and intergenerational trauma. reportManga rec by CourtRoseFaerie - Feb 21, 2023

Kitchen no Ohimesama
add



Kitchen Princess and The Gentlemen's Alliance Cross are both drama series with intense plot twists and heavy themes, including that of parental abuse and neglect. They're both set in fancy private schools.

Kitchen Princess is more realistic and grounded than Gentlemen's Alliance, and I think it handles the plot twists, characters, and love triangle a bit better. Gentlemen's Alliance is more focused on romance overall and has a larger cast of characters.

When I was reading Gentlemen's Alliance I couldn't stop comparing it to Kitchen Princess. reportManga rec by CourtRoseFaerie - Feb 21, 2023

Although the MC of Hen na Ryuu had a very friendly relationship with his hero party contrary to how the MC of Kaiko sareta Ankoku Heishi, the plots for both of these stories are similar. They both retire from their old job and look down on themselves for not being anything special when in reality they are extremely overpowered. Both stories revolve around settling down in a place far away from everything else and growing out their village.  reportManga rec by Dignity - Feb 21, 2023

They both have a similar theme going on with the MC causing massive political upheavals with everything he does while simultaneously having zero idea of the deeper implications of his actions.

Bonjour♪Koiaji Pâtisserie
add



These dessert-themed slice of school life shoujo follow the same formula:

The protagonist is a scholarship kid in a school of rich and famous personalities who dreams of becoming a famous pâtissière, her genuine optimism and desire to make people smile with her desserts enable her to win over even the hardest hearts, and naturally her overwhelming empathy and kindness will bring all the boys to her yard.

Bonjour♪Koiaji Pâtisserie is a tragically short sampler for what Kitchen Princess is all about, but it does have an anime (and a game series) under its belt! The characters are easy to love and easy to root for; but most importantly, these stories provide some much-needed healing comfort in the form of delicious-looking food and touching friendships! reportManga rec by WolfieGrrrl - Feb 19, 2023

How to Play the Manga Reading Challenge Shiritori!
Shiritori is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word.
Here, you will choose a manga for your first item, and the last letter (or syllable) has to be the same as your next manga's first letter (or syllable), and so on.
To finish the challenge, you need to complete a chain using the amount of items required for your chosen difficulty.Signing Up
Go to the Sign Up Code post, copy the provided code in its entirety, and paste it as a new reply to this thread.

Edit your post to replace the capitalized text with your information.

The following fields should be filled in now: Link to your list and Completed Manga.

Choose a difficulty based on the number of manga you want to read.
　　Eloquent: 12 items;　Writer: 24 items;　Author: 36 items;　Scholar: 48 items;　Laureate: 60 items

Edit your post to fill in your chosen difficulty.
This can be changed later.

Determine if you want to play using the last letter or last syllable rules. 

(optional) Grab a participant banner from our Banners List and show it off on your profile/forum signature.Completing Challenge Items
Begin completing manga challenge items and edit them into your sign-up post. For example: 
1. [Started: DATE] [Finished: DATE]
(1) Read a Manhua or a Manhwa.
MANGA_TITLE[*] [color=DIMGRAY][Started: DATE] [Finished: DATE][/color]
(1) Read a [url=https://myanimelist.net/topmanga.php?type=manhua]Manhua[/url] or a [url=https://myanimelist.net/topmanga.php?type=manhwa]Manhwa[/url].
[url=http://myanimelist.net/manga/ID_NUM]MANGA_TITLE[/url]becomes: 
1. [Started: Jan 10] [Finished: Feb 12] 
(1) Read a Manhua or a Manhwa. 
The Horizon[*] [color=GREEN][Started: Jan 10] [Finished: Feb 12][/color] 
(1) Read a [url=https://myanimelist.net/topmanga.php?type=manhua]Manhua[/url] or a [url=https://myanimelist.net/topmanga.php?type=manhwa]Manhwa[/url]. 
[url=http://myanimelist.net/manga/125036]The Horizon[/url]
DATE is when you started/finished each manga.
ID_NUM is found in the manga entry's URL. MANGA_TITLE is the main title of the entry.

Continue chaining manga together until you have enough items to complete your chosen difficulty. Remember, each manga can only be used once. 

There are two modes in this challenge, to make it a bit more interesting for the hardcore readers between us: last letter, and last syllable shiritori.
Last letter means only the last letter needs to be the same as the first letter of the next manga.
Last syllable means the last syllable needs to be the same as the first syllable of the next manga.


Example last letter:
Read a manga with a one word title: Akumetsu
Read a manga with a main character that wears glasses: Umineko no Naku Koro ni - Episode 1: Legend of the Golden Witch

Example last syllable:
Read a manga with a one word title: Akumetsu
Read a manga with a main character that wears glasses: Tsurezure Children

For the purposes of this challenge, last syllable (when it comes to English titles) refers to the last pair of consonant + vowel.
You can use full syllables for English titles, but it's not obligatory.

For example:
Fullmetal Alchemist -> Mister X wo Sagase -> See You Later, Mermaid -> Maid kara Haha ni Narimashita -> Tandem -> Demi-chan wa Kataritai
or
Tandem (Tandemu) -> Mushishi 

For Japanese titles, it refers to the last kana.
In katakana titles, a long vowel may either be ignored or considered as a vowel.

For example:
Hunter x Hunter (ハンターハンター, Hantaa Hantaa) -> Tamashii no Futago
or
Hunter x Hunter (ハンターハンター, Hantaa Hantaa) -> Another (アナザー, Anazaa) -> Zashiki Onna

Different from the usual rules of shiritori, you don't lose when you choose a manga that ends with n; it follows the same rule as any other letter (or syllable), except you can choose whether to add the previous letters to it.

For example:
D.Gray-man -> Naruto -> To LOVE-Ru
or
D.Gray-man -> Manhole -> Let's☆Lagoon 

Titles originally in English, such as Bleach or Fullmetal Alchemist, can be used without issue for last letter shiritori, but can be modified for last syllable shiritori if necessary.
You can either use the romanization of the title, such as Buriichi (from ブリーチ), or an alternative Japanese title, such as Hagane no Renkinjutsushi (as Furumetaru Arukemisuto is not a widely recognized romanization).
If in doubt, check the alternative titles in MAL. 

Acronyms are not valid for last syllable shiritori if there's a full title available.

For example:
FMA, HxH, GTO (Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter x Hunter, Great Teacher Onizuka) 

Acronyms without full titles available can be romanized in order to use them for last syllable shiritori, following MAL's (or other databases') titles or asking staff.

For example:
SSS! into Esu Esu Esu (from エスエスエス)

Symbols at the start or end of a title can be chained with any other symbol.

Numbers at the start or end of a title count as letters and need to be the same (only the first and last digit, even in last syllable shiritori).


The items do not need to be completed in any specific order, but it is easier to plan ahead of time what you're going to read, as finding something that both starts with a specific letter (or syllable) and ends with a specific letter (or syllable) can be harder.

If you use a title other than the main title, please add it between parenthesis after the main title.

As long as you try to make it work and it makes sense, we are going to be lenient with the meaning of last syllable (for English titles), but it's up to the discretion of the staff. 
However, we don't recommend using English titles for last syllable shiritori unless you understand how shiritori usually works or are okay with asking for clarification and accepting the staff's decision.Turning In

Challenge List with Explanations

Screenshots are suggested as evidence for some items which require information that could change by the time/after you turn-in. 
The provided suggestions are manga that we approved to be valid.
You can still choose to use titles not tagged with the required elements at your own risk.
If it isn't apparent based on cover/description/character description, you may provide some sort of proof for it (for easier inspection).
That goes for info (like age, etc.) that might not be apparent, as well.
MRC Staff Jokers: For the difficulty you want to attempt, you can choose a select number of MRC Staff Jokers as a ""wild card"".
(Eloquent: 1 Joker, Writer: 2 Jokers, Author: 3 Jokers, Scholar: 4 Jokers, Laureate: 5 Jokers).
This means you don't have to fit them into any requirement - they are valid on their own.
Leave them under MRC Staff Jokers in your form, and delete the ones you didn't read when turning in.
However: You don't have to use them as wild cards (and thus a replacement).
If you want to read and fit them into a requirement, you can read as many of them as you want and the restriction above won't apply in this case.

for when you want to feel something (anime)
Animeby
PoutyWeeb 
Inspired by bel’s list on letterboxd

https://letterboxd.com/ellefnning/list/for-when-you-want-to-feel-something/

A list filled with a wide variety of animes that’ll inflict emotions of some sort, whether it’s positive or negative (or perhaps even a mix of both). All the animes listed here are animes that has personally affected me, for better or for worse. I hope you can find something here that at least wouldn’t feel like another boring isekai and hopefully leaves some sort of lasting impact on your mind.

For simplicity’s sake, any animes with multiple entries I’ll only add the first entry and drop the most ideal watch order next to it.

This list will be constantly updating as I’m still watching more animes, so look out for more entries in the future!

3. Review (if I did one)

Please read the following before filling out the “Contact Customer Support” form. The link to the form is located at the bottom.
English is the only available language for MAL support; we are unable to answer inquiries in any other languages. We apologize for the inconvenience.
Password Recovery
If you are unable to login to your account, please follow the steps which apply to you.
I know my registered email and have access to it
Please go here and request a new password. If it does not arrive to your inbox after several minutes, please check your spam/junk folders. If the password still does not arrive (Hotmail, Live, and Outlook email domains), please click the ""contact customer support"" button and fill out the form including ""I know my registered email and have access, but the email does not arrive"" at the top of the inquiry.
I don't remember my registered email
Please go here and select ""I do not remember the email address registered on my MAL account"". An email will be sent to your provided email address with a hint to your registered email. If it does not arrive to your inbox after several minutes, please enter a different email address.
I know my registered email, but do not have access to it
Please go here and select ""I cannot use the email address registered on my MAL account anymore"". The form will use your old password (if your account is still locked from May 2018) and other information from your device to verify your identity. If the form succeeds, you will be sent a new password to your provided email within several minutes.

No email arrives after completing the form
Please check your spam/junk folders. If it's not there, please enter a different email address. Hotmail, Live, and Outlook email domains often have problems receiving our emails.
The email says the form cannot verify my identity
The form uses your last login information, so please:

try completing the form with all of your devices (mobile, desktop, tablet)
try at all possible locations (work, home, school)
ensure your last password is correct by checking your browser settings for saved passwords (e.g. chrome://settings/passwords in Chrome)

I tried all my devices, at all locations, and still cannot get a new password
Please collect any information that we could use to verify your identity. This includes:

receipts from MAL Supporter payments or Manga Store purchases
other email addresses or social media accounts (Steam, Twitch, Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Last.fm) that you have written publicly on your MAL account (""Also Available At"").

Once you have this information, please click the ""contact customer support"" button and fill out the form, write
      ""I do not have access to my registered email and the form won't help me"" at the top, and include all of this information in your inquiry.

Two Factor Authentication (2FA)
We recommend to increase your account security by enabling a second verification step after your password. To activate or deactivate this feature, please follow the instructions on the account settings page.

I lost access to the authentication app on my smart device
    When you enabled 2FA, you were given 5 backup codes to save in a safe place. If you've lost access to the authentication app on your smart device, you can use one of these backup codes to log in. When prompted to enter the 6-digit app code, click ""enter an unused backup code instead"". Please note that each backup code can only be used once.
  

I lost access to the app and my backup codes
    If you cannot log in because you lost access to both the app and your backup codes, please click the ""contact customer support"" button and fill out the form using your registered email address. Write ""I cannot access my 2FA app and lost my backup codes"" at the top, and include any other information we can use to verify your identity in your inquiry.
  
Account Deletion
All account deletion requests are permanent. You cannot reactivate a deleted account or recover any account information after requesting a deletion. This includes purchased manga, MAL supporter status, anime/manga lists, private messages, and more.
You must save any information you would like to keep before requesting the deletion. Forum posts made by you will remain as ""removed_user"", so please manually delete any you would like erased.

I know my registered email and have access to it
    Please go here after saving any information you would like to keep.

Watch Cool Doji Danshi~　✧　Nov 9, 2012 4:44 AM#2KinetaLead AdminFaerie QueenOfflineAug 20075960Database Problems

I can't find a particular anime/manga entry on MAL.
First of all, make sure the entry meets the Database Guidelines.  Foreign productions (e.g. Avatar, Original English Language ""manga"") and Korean webcomics are not allowed.

You may also check the recent posts in the removals/merges/denials threads for the entry you are concerned about, to ensure it hasn't been submitted and denied before.
Anime | Manga | Characters & People

Some series are hard to find with the MAL search. If the title is not in the threads above, you can try searching the title by using Google. Use these queries:
site:myanimelist.net/anime ""anime title"" | site:myanimelist.net/manga ""manga title""

If you still cannot find the entry you are looking for, you may submit it to the database.


I would like to add a new anime/manga/character/person to the database.
First make sure that you have gone through the steps above. If you cannot find a denial for the entry and it meets our guidelines, you can add the entry here:
Add Anime | Add Manga | Add Character | Add People

A moderator will review your submission and approve or deny it. This may take a while, so please wait patiently.


How long does it take for submissions to be approved?
Currently, the queue is quite long. Depending on the importance of the submission, it can take a few days up to a few months until it gets approved. Please wait patiently and do not re-submit your submission as this will slow down the entire process.


I would like to modify a database entry.
Under the main picture and on the right side of some sections of every entry are ""Edit"" links.  Please use them to submit modifications to be approved.  If the edit button does not have the option you would like to submit, please use one of the respective threads:
Anime DB Modifications | Manga DB Modifications


I have a question about a database entry.
First familiarize yourself with the Database Guidelines. If your question is unanswered, please post your question in the respective subboard.
Anime | Manga | Characters & People


A database entry disappeared from my list/favorites.
Check the recent posts in the removals/merges/denials threads for the entry you are concerned about.

I have a problem/question about the parental consent process.
Please contact Customer Support here.


I have a problem/question about MAL Supporter.
Please check the MAL Supporter FAQ. If the FAQ doesn't answer your question please contact Customer Support here.


I'm being told that I have new club invitations but I don't.
Use the Reset Invite Counter link on the  club invitation page.


I can't add a favorite to my list even though I have room for it.
Clear all of your favorites (the link is at the bottom of the favorites edit list), wait a few minutes and then re-add everything.


How can I make my profile private?
It's not possible. If you don't want others to see personal information don't fill out the fields and use PMs for conversation.


How can I remove my own reviews/recommendations?
See here for reviews and here for recommendations.


I found an illegitimate account (spambot/rating troll/etc.) and would like to report it.
Rating trolls: We have a system that detects such accounts automatically. For more information see here.
Spambots: Please report spam directly by using the report links (forum post, comments, PMs). If there is no report link (blogs, VA pages) please use the report link on the user profile.
Other: Please use the report link on the user profile and provide a detailed explanation.


Trying to post a review gives me a ""400 Bad Request"" error. Help!
This usually happens if you use the browser addon ""LastPass"" (or another addon that interferes with the website). If you disable it, you should be able to post the review.LunaOct 3, 2021 12:14 AM

Watch Cool Doji Danshi~　✧　Nov 9, 2012 4:44 AM#4KinetaLead AdminFaerie QueenOfflineAug 20075960List Problems

My profile stats say I have more entries than I actually do. What's going on?
Series that you are re-watching are still counted as ""completed"" on the profile stats.


How can I delete my entire list / several entries at once?
The feature for deleting the entire list has been removed due to performance issues. Currently you have to delete every entry manually.


My list has disappeared/doesn't show up.
Go here and change the ""Default Status Selected"" option.


I see my list style on everyone else's list / I see different list styles when logged in and logged out.
Go here and uncheck the ""Override user list styles and only use the one I want"" option.


How can I make parts of my list private (e.g., hide hentai)?
It's not possible. If you don't want others to see certain entries, don't add them.


How can I see the full history of added/watched episodes/chapters?
The history page shows all updates for the current week and the last 3 weeks. It's not possible to show more weeks. On the history page you can click ""edit"" next to an entry go get a more detailed history of this entry. This detailed list, however, is regularly cleared when there haven't been updates for this entry (usually 30 days, can be longer).


A manga title doesn't show up in the history.
When you add a manga title for the first time to your list or just change the volume count, it doesn't show up in the history. To force it to show up in the history list, you will have to change the chapter count.


My Profile List/Anime/Manga stats won't update! Days watched are incorrect!
Depending on how many users are currently updating their lists, the stats update can take a few minutes or a few hours. Please wait patiently, your stats will update eventually.


An anime entry keeps showing up in my ""currently watching""  list even though I keep moving it to ""completed"".
Anime entries with the status ""currently airing"" can't be set to completed. If you completed an entry in the past and it is later set to ""currently airing"", it will be moved back to your currently watching list. This happens mostly with OVAs which get more episodes later.


An anime entry keeps showing up in my ""plan to watch""  list even though I keep moving it to ""currently watching"".
Anime entries with the status ""not yet aired"" can't be set to watching. Once a day an automatic process checks all lists and moves these entries back to plan to watch.LunaMay 25, 2020 8:20 AM

How do I delete my own thread?
You have a set amount of time that you can remove your own thread as long as no one else posts in it. If you would like the thread removed after that point, report the thread (using the report link on your post) and request a removal.


My post count doesn't increase.
Post count does not increase in Forum Games.


How can I make a topic sticky?
Edit the post and choose ""Additional Options -> Importance -> Sticky"". You need to be an admin in the club to do this. You can't do this on the main forums.


I can see my picture on my profile and in the top right corner of the website, but not on the forum.
The picture on the forum (called ""avatar"") is different from your profile picture. You can upload/change/delete your forum avatar here.


My forum avatar and/or signature won't appear on the forum.
Go here and ensure Work Mode is set to ""Show signatures and avatars"".LunaMay 25, 2020 8:12 AM

I would like to be the admin of a club with no creator or an inactive creator.
Post your request here.


How do I delete my club?
First consider passing on the club to another active member and just leaving it.  If you would still like to delete it and it is a public club, remove all of the members and leave the club yourself. This should delete the club. If it isn't removed, or the club is private/secret, please PM a DB administrator.

 Login      Projects   You Should Read This Manga 2023: Nominate now! You Should Read This Manga 2023: Nominate now! Published: Feb 1, 2023 Updated: Feb 1, 2023  Table of contents Introduction Nomination Criteria How to Nominate Missing Manga? Terms and Conditions Introduction 
          Annual manga lists, such as the ""Kono Manga ga Sugoi!"" rankings and Manga Taisho Award, are a great way to find new manga to read. There is only one problem: many of the titles which appear in these lists have yet to be licensed overseas (and aren't guaranteed to ever be).
         ""You Should Read This Manga"" aims to create an annual manga discovery list for the international fan. Passionate manga readers—MAL members, bookstore employees, and more—can nominate any title that has recently been licensed and released outside Japan. While this doesn't guarantee all finalist manga will be available in every region, it greatly increases the probability for it to be licensed (now or later).
         
          Are you passionate about manga? Send us your nominations!
         See Eligible Manga Deadline: February 27, 2023 7:00 pm (PT)
         Nomination Criteria 
          You can nominate up to 5 titles for the main ""You Should Read This Manga"" list, and up to 3 titles for each subcategory. The criteria for the main list also applies to the subcategory lists.
         ""You Should Read This Manga"" (main) 
            Since our goal is to spotlight relatively new and unknown manga available to the international fan, there are few conditions for nominations:
           
              At least one volume of the manga was published overseas in 2022.
             
              The manga's Rank & Popularity on MAL are both under #50.
             
              You really want to recommend this manga to a friend!
             ""Should be anime"" (sub) 
              Cannot have an anime adaptation released in the last 5 years.
             ""Best for beginners"" (sub) 
              Can easily be enjoyed by new manga readers (e.g. who have read 5 titles or less).
             ""Unique art/story"" (sub) 
              For well-versed manga readers who are looking for something fresh.
             How to Nominate 
              This page is for MAL member nominations, so you must be logged into your MAL account to access the form.
             
              Once you're logged in, you can easily cross-check your completed manga list with the eligible titles.
             
              After you've chosen your nominations, send them our way using the form below!
             See Eligible Manga Missing Manga? 
          Was a manga published in your region during 2022, but you don't see it in the eligible manga list? Please use the form below to let us know and we'll have it added ASAP. You can still send in your nomination without waiting for it to appear!

          Multimedia hip-hop project
          In the near future, the Phantom Live movement was born anew from the incredible saturation of hip-hop culture.
         
          Rappers have accessories containing a metallic substance called Phantom Metal.​ ​Through chemical reactions with their own DNA, they create illusions linked to their emotions, driving young people wild with spectacular stage shows.
         
          At the Paradox Live event, held at the legendary CLUB Paradox, which has suddenly returned upon the scene, four teams—BAE, The Cat's Whiskers, cozmez, and Akanyatsura—battled for supremacy.
         
          Although cozmez seized the victory, the intensity of the struggle won the hearts of legendary rappers BURAIKAN, igniting the spark of a new event.
         
          After that, BURAIKAN went all over Japan to spread the word about the new event: ""This event will determine the next legendary artist. There is only one condition for participation—being a Phantom Rapper. ​Your position, your title: they don't matter. Come on, everyone.""
         
          Inspired by this message, many intensely skilled contestants approached BURAIKAN.
          From the most outstanding candidates, eight teams were selected.
         
          Now the fight is getting fiercer, and the momentum is sure to take Phantom Live to new heights.
          Who will be the next legendary artist?

 Vinland Saga Season 2


After his father's death and the destruction of his village at the hands of English raiders, Einar wishes for a peaceful life with his family on their newly rebuilt farms. However, fate has other plans: his village is invaded once again. Einar watches helplessly as the marauding Danes burn his lands and slaughter his family. The invaders capture Einar and take him back to Denmark as a slave. 

Einar clings to his mother's final words to survive. He is purchased by Ketil, a kind slave owner and landlord who promises that Einar can regain his freedom in return for working in the fields. Soon, Einar encounters his new partner in farm cultivation—Thorfinn, a dejected and melancholic slave. As Einar and Thorfinn work together toward their freedom, they are haunted by both sins of the past and the ploys of the present. Yet they carry on, grasping for a glimmer of hope, redemption, and peace in a world that is nothing but unjust and unforgiving.

 Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha: Shijou Saikyou no Maou no Shiso, Tensei shite Shison-tachi no Gakkou e Kayou II


As peace returns to the demon realm, Anos Voldigoad wishes nothing more than to put his reputation as the Demon King of Tyranny to rest and go back to being a misfit at the prestigious Demon King Academy. Unfortunately, any tranquility is fleeting: sinister demons, kings, and deities plot Anos's demise from the shadows.

 Tokyo Revengers: Seiya Kessen-hen


In spite of his best time-leaping efforts, Takemichi Hanagaki continuously fails to prevent the present-day death of Hinata Tachibana, his adolescent love. The adult Takemichi grapples with grief and the ramifications of the Tokyo Manji gang's criminal empire—an unintended product of his timeline meddling. Though the gang once operated under the idealistic Manjirou ""Mikey"" Sano, it has now been taken over by the malicious Tetta Kisaki and, as a result, has abandoned its original optimistic intent.

Despite feeling hopeless, Takemichi travels to the past once again to investigate Black Dragon, a rival motorcycle gang whose actions ultimately lead to Hinata's demise. There, he meets the young Hakkai Shiba, a fellow gang member whose older brother, Taiju, tyrannically rules Black Dragon. When Taiju brutally beats Takemichi in a one-sided street brawl, Hakkai attempts to withdraw from Tokyo Manji in apology—an act that Takemichi must prevent to spare Hakkai a grim future.

Through a shared tragedy, Takemichi bonds with Chifuyu Matsuno, establishing a close comradery both boys desperately need. With Chifuyu on his side, Takemichi works to unravel the fates of Black Dragon's members, fighting to create a happy future for his loved ones.

As it turns out, Fuyutsuki-san is his new coworker.

At the office, the cool-headed Fuyutsuki-san offers simple and rational solutions to Himuro-kun's icy dilemmas—everything from helping him garden without freezing his plants to ensuring he does not melt during their tropical work retreat.

During a blizzard, Masayuki Muroi's old high school friend pushes him off a mountain to certain death. However, Masayuki survives the fall and escapes to safety thanks to Yuki-Onna, the spirit of a beautiful young woman who is said to lead men to their demise—but all she asks in return is money.

Eleven years later, Masayuki has lived a successful life, having gotten married and amassing a great fortune. But when his company collapses and his wife cheats on him, Masayuki retreats to the city where Yuki-Onna once saved him, and he reconnects with her by offering her money and tasty meals. While Masayuki recovers from his misfortunes, another one knocks on his door: his ex-wife is found beaten to death, and now only Yuki-Onna—who cannot reveal herself—can corroborate his alibi.

With no one to turn to, Yuki-Onna enlists the help of the spirits' God of Wisdom, Kotoko Iwanaga. Revered by the various spirits that wander the earth, Kotoko uses her extraordinary wits and cunning to solve all quarrels they may have. In her duty to protect spirits and humans from colliding, Kotoko drags along her immortal boyfriend, Kurou Sakuragawa, and promises to prove Masayuki's innocence without exposing Yuki-Onna's existence.

Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing ""magicology"" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth.

Due to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard. Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée. After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fiancée as a bully.

After crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing. She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to. Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllia's company.

As the night goes on, they take turns divulging their grievances and the hobbies they have taken up as a means of coping. While their stories are utterly different, there is one common thread: betrayal. Each of the four, having been bitterly betrayed by someone they treasured, has developed a deep-seated distrust of humanity.

But in addition to their similar worldviews, the four have one more commonality: a critical lack of funds. Realizing that things cannot continue as they are, they decide to form a party, rank up, and make as much money as possible to spend on their respective hobbies. What these disillusioned adventurers do not know, however, is that they will one day save the world from unfathomable peril.

But the man they find near the desolate town of Jeneora Rock is a far cry from the lethal terrorist they expect. In reality, Vash is a passive and carefree drifter; he is a proponent of peace, beloved by the residents of the town.

The hero king Inglis—who dedicated his entire life to building his country—is now approaching death. To award him for his honorable achievements, the goddess Alistia appears and grants him one wish. Having never been able to master the blade, Inglis asks to be reincarnated in order to do so.

In a blink of an eye, Inglis finds himself born in the far future as a daughter of the Eucus noble family. Six years later, Inglis is discovered to be Runeless—incapable of utilizing the runes that enable the use of magic in this era. She is therefore ineligible to become a knight. However, this fits in well with Inglis' plan: she instead decides to become the squire for her cousin, Rafinha Bilford, allowing Inglis to focus on pushing her limits.

For Inglis, the challenges this familiar yet different world has to offer are instead opportunities for her to hone her skills—and possibly become an extraordinary squire in the process.

Benriya Saitou-san, Isekai ni Iku


Despite being a handyman with a wide range of skills, Saitou is severely undervalued and underpaid. When he complains, his boss fires him, claiming that he is easily replaceable. As if his luck was not bad enough, a truck suddenly hits and kills Saitou on his way home.

Surprisingly enough, Saitou does not die; instead, he is transported to another world. There, he meets a party composed of the female knight Raelza, the moonlight fairy Lafanpan, and the mage Morlock, who are all coincidentally looking to recruit a new member with a skill set like Saitou's.

Throughout their time together, Saitou uses his expertise to assist his fellow party members and soon comes to receive the recognition he never thought was possible. However, Saitou's presence may just be the catalyst that will connect a diverse cast of people from different places, slowly uncovering the fate that could bring a great change to this world.

For more than 30 years, Dariel has been a loyal soldier in the Demon King's army, having been raised by Granverza, one of the Four Heavenly Generals. However, as Dariel lacks any magical potential, he is nothing but a disgrace in the eyes of Granverza's son, Bashubaza, who fires Dariel right after assuming his father's position as a general.

Stripped of a home and a job, Dariel wanders the forests, where he stumbles upon a human girl named Marika running from a monster. After Dariel intervenes to help Marika, she invites him to stay at her village in return. There, he discovers that the reason he has zero suitability for magic as a demon is that he is, in fact, a human.

However, Dariel is no ordinary human. Possessing potential that far outweighs even heroes, Dariel may soon find himself involved in the humans and demons' seemingly never-ending conflict, facing against the race he once considered allies.

Later, her plan is further derailed when she finds out that Towa has enrolled in the same high school as herself and Sanae.

The higher the climb, the more prize money is awarded.

Androids Cobalt, Chrom, Neon, and Kei are down on their luck and about to have their electricity cut off from unpaid bills. Desperate to make a quick buck, the group decide to become Babel climbers. However, winning the audience's favor is a great challenge. Dejected but unwilling to give up, Cobalt resolves to somehow improve their chances after watching an impressive performance by STAND-ALONE—the top climber unit.

When the group stumbles across a mysterious choreographer willing to give away his routine, Cobalt sees this as their only way up. With the help of their human companion, Esora Shibaura, the androids form the unit KNoCC to tackle the daunting climb to the top of Babel, but they must also overcome android-based discrimination along the way.

Gol D. Roger was known as the ""Pirate King,"" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.

Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

Yoichi Isagi was mere moments away from scoring a goal that would have sent his high school soccer team to the nationals, but a split-second decision to pass the ball to his teammate cost him that reality. Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. 

The project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.

For as long as he can remember, Minoru Kagenou has been fixated on becoming as strong as possible, which has led him to undertake all kinds of rigorous training. This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.

But instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world—one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker ""Shadow"" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.

One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act, so the men dose him with an experimental drug formulated by their criminal organization, leaving him to his death. However, to his own astonishment, Shinichi lives to see another day, but now in the body of a seven-year-old child.

Perfectly preserving his original intelligence, he hides his real identity from everyone, including his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, private detective Kogorou Mouri. To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa.

Detective Conan follows Shinichi who, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri's cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug's effects someday.

After a fatal encounter with a truck, Takafumi Takaoka's uncle, Yousuke ""Ojisan"" Shibazaki, lies comatose for 17 years. When he finally regains consciousness, Ojisan begins to ramble in a foreign tongue and reveals that he had been transported to a magical world called Gran Bahamal. Takafumi dismisses his uncle's claims as nonsense until an incantation makes a cup of water hover in the air. In a flash of brilliance, the pair creates a YouTube channel to showcase Ojisan's magical abilities.

The responsibility now falls on Takafumi's shoulders to acquaint Ojisan with everything that has transpired during his absence, including getting him up to speed with the internet, new technology, and surprisingly, the outcome of the '90s console war—the result of which was especially distressing for a hardcore SEGA fan. With Ojisan's wisdom from his other world experiences, they grow their YouTube channel and tackle online comments and trolls. The journey of this uncle-nephew duo promises to be anything but conventional.

IDOLiSH7 Third Beat! Part 2


IDOLiSH7 is more successful than ever, but no one is smiling because a new threat has taken the stage: the debuting idol group ŹOOĻ. Managed by the nefarious entertainment executive Ryou Tsukumo, they will stop at nothing to get their way, resorting to all kinds of underhanded tactics to bring down their rivals. TRIGGER's image has already been ruined by scandal, and IDOLiSH7 and Re:vale are headed for the same fate—or worse.

Meanwhile, Zero, the legendary idol who disappeared 15 years ago, continues to haunt the present through those he left behind. His manager seems to be in contact with Tsukumo for his own schemes, and Zero's songwriter reveals himself in a letter after having been missing for years. IDOLiSH7 finds an ally in Re:vale to thwart ŹOOĻ's plans while trying to make sense of Zero's colleagues' actions, but it may be impossible for everyone to emerge unscathed.

Sazae-san


The main character is a mother named Sazae-san. She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to ""The Partridge Family"" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like ""Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost"". Such ""boring"" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered ""acceptable"" by adults.

One day, while searching for extraterrestrial creatures, Yuuhi and Yuamu find a strange spot in the forest where many trees have fallen, forming a scenery similar to a crop circle. As they venture further, they discover a mysterious spaceship and enter it out of curiosity. To their surprise, they come across Yudias Velgear, an alien from the Velgear Star Cluster. As it turns out, Yudias is seeking to learn about Rush Duel—a card game popular among elementary school students—as he believes that it will save his home from a long war.

With the siblings agreeing to teach Yudias about Rush Duel, they eventually realize that their first contact with an alien may not be a random coincidence.

As these ninja mingled with the other clans, their bloodline thinned, and they gradually faded from sight. The descendants of these ninja clans, seeking to preserve their heritage, formed the WNA (World Ninja Association) in the hope of carrying on their legacy.

And so it was that the WNA succeeded in developing Ninja-Gum, an art which could summon forth the strength of the Shinobi. And yet creating the most powerful Ninja-Gum requires the strongest of ninja DNA. So it was that the Ninjala Tournament was held, that the mightiest of all ninjas could be found...

Gokushufudou Season 2


With a wicked scar on his face, a terrifying gaze, and an apron adorned with a teddy bear, ex-yakuza member Tatsu proudly assumes the role of a full-time househusband. Already familiar with the regular challenges of grocery shopping, Tatsu now takes it to the next level by joining a women's organization—but acceptance is not easily achieved without first mastering the elegance of flower arranging and housekeeping.

Approaching homemaking ventures through the lens of his former occupation, Tatsu faces haiku battles, typhoon alerts, and cosplaying villains. For his dearest wife Miku, Tatsu will do anything, even if he is interrupted by his old acquaintances, whose former vigor has also yet to subside. Never faltering before a new challenge, Tatsu's tranquil days as a househusband are proving to be just as hectic as before.

EditSynopsisAfter his father's death and the destruction of his village at the hands of English raiders, Einar wishes for a peaceful life with his family on their newly rebuilt farms. However, fate has other plans: his village is invaded once again. Einar watches helplessly as the marauding Danes burn his lands and slaughter his family. The invaders capture Einar and take him back to Denmark as a slave. 

Einar clings to his mother's final words to survive. He is purchased by Ketil, a kind slave owner and landlord who promises that Einar can regain his freedom in return for working in the fields. Soon, Einar encounters his new partner in farm cultivation—Thorfinn, a dejected and melancholic slave. As Einar and Thorfinn work together toward their freedom, they are haunted by both sins of the past and the ploys of the present. Yet they carry on, grasping for a glimmer of hope, redemption, and peace in a world that is nothing but unjust and unforgiving.

                                      (3/24 eps)
                                   
                Summary: A 180 from season 1 which may leave many anime-only viewers questioning whether they should continue the Vinland adventure.

Story
Season 2 appears as a full slice-of-life rather than focusing on development through conflict, history, politics, and visuals. It also doesn't appear to follow season 1 necessarily and instead, almost presents itself as a different show entirely. The pacing is substantially slower as we no longer see quick character development. Growth, and thus the story, is nearly halted to tortoise speed.

Visuals
They're good but do not live up to season 1. It's been a while since season 1 and considering its success, season 2 should have been
                  ...
at minimum, around the same. Instead, many scenes appear as stills, almost like a PowerPoint. The visuals themselves don't appear as vibrant or commanding of attention. Something about it all feels like a downgrade, although, still good enough.

Sound
Sound is on par from what you may remember from the previous season. It's pretty good, setting the mood and background of whatever setting is displayed. Nothing extraordinary noteworthy however.

Overall
I'm not impressed with the 180-turn the anime has taken. It disappointed me and may leave many anime-only viewers questioning the overall content and pacing. Similarly, if the two seasons were flipped, viewers may find themselves asking the same questions.

                                      (3/24 eps)
                                   
                A new season of Vinland Saga. Vinland Saga's 1st season aired in 2019, yet this sequel is just as amazing, if not better, than its predecessor, despite having a lot less action and more attention to characters in the arc it focuses on, the Farmland Arc. 
This is my first review of an anime. Note that this review is purely from an anime-only perspective.
Naturally, spoilers for season 1 will appear, so please read at your own discretion.


STORY: 10
Vinland Saga has always had an amazing story, and so far it's been simply captivating. It should be noted that season 1 is considered as the prologue of
                  ...
this tale, and season 2 is where the ""real"" story begins. 
In the first episode we see this season's deuteragonist Einar's story and how he winds up in Ketil's farm. The show does a very good job of attaching the viewer to characters they just met, which not a lot of shows can claim of doing as well.  The next 2 episodes show us a lot more of the new Thorfinn, who is broken and sullen from the climax of season 1, where Askelaad, the man he had made his life's purpose to kill, was killed by someone else. Despite how early we are on the season, Vinland Saga has managed to easily enrapture its audience. 

The series' pacing has considerably slowed down compared to last season, with fights and plot developments left and right at a breakneck pace. Season 2, in contrast, seems to be focusing on its characters for the time being. Action scenes aren't nearly as commonplace and the show takes a more SoL-oriented turn. However, none of this takes away from Vinland's strength, which is drawing its viewers into its beautiful yet horrifying world. The season paves the way for some serious character development, but might turn off some viewers who were attracted to Vinland Saga for its showy fights and lightning action and pacing.
The story takes a more dismal turn at some parts, largely focusing on death and its consequences. Topics such as ""what it means to live"" are briefly brought up.


CHARACTERS: 9
The characters in VInland Saga have always been one of its strong points, and this season has done nothing but exemplify that point. Thorfinn, our main character, is a broken war veteran who has lost his life's purpose and lives for the sake of living. On the other hand, Einar lives everyday in the hope of a better tomorrow, despite his dark past. This stark difference in the outlook of life between these two characters is highlighted in many different scenes, such as when Einar tries to make conversation with an unwilling Thorfinn, who seems to only answer questions he deems necessarily demand an answer. 3 episodes in, the show doesn't boast of too many fleshed out side characters yet, although Snake, the head of the bodyguards, and Arnheid definitely show potential to be very interesting.


ART: 8
Season 1 was done by Studio WIT, which did an incredible job of animating Vinland Saga. This time, the reins have been handed over to MAPPA, yet the team animating the series has stayed mostly the same. The backgrounds look absolutely divine and it shines through in almost every frame. Each cut looks more breathtaking than the last. 
Some still shots have been used in scenes where motion would normally be expected, which is a slight step down from season 1. The characters, in some scenes, notably stand out as simply drawn in contrast to the highly detailed backgrounds they stand in. They look slightly strange in some shots, but it doesn't take away from the experience exceedingly. 



SOUND: 8
The soundtrack doesn't stand out flashily but is able to deliver impact successfully when necessary. Some tracks were able to greatly enhance certain scenes where not too much was going on. The OP is stunning in both visuals and music, and notably, both the OP and ED are sung in English. The ED is also quite good in both the visuals and music department, though I personally prefer the OP.
The voice actors do a very good job, adding a weight to its characters that so differentiates anime from manga as a medium. No voice actors in the cast stand out greatly however, but they work together as seamlessly as a well oiled machine, with each voice actor breathing life into their character.


ENJOYMENT: 10
This season of Vinland Saga has been an amazing ride so far, with each episode exploring different facets of its character's personalities. Each episodes seems to transport the viewer into a different world, the world of the Vikings. Episodes feel like 2 minutes instead of 25, and keep the viewer longing for more every week. This season may not be as appealing to people who like more fights in their anime, but I nevertheless recommend that they try a couple episodes out before passing judgement.
Although we're just 3 episodes in, if the manga readers can be taken seriously, it's certain that the rest of this season will be just as amazing as it is so far, and I cannot wait for it. 

I highly recommend Vinland Saga Season 2 to anyone who watched its first season. It may take an episode or two to get into, but once you've started you can never go back

Thanks for reading my first review!

                                      (3/24 eps)
                                  Spoiler 
                kinda spoiler warning
vinland saga s2 starts off kind of dry, it leaves off after season 1 which has many unexplained question like ""what happens to thorfinn"" or at the start of this season ""where's the action""

At first it might bore you, but you'll slowly realise that this season is what vinland sagas plot is supposed to be the entire time
between the first season its always mentioned about a place without fighting which was the main reason for the first season to show that thorfinn is going to go on a pursue that aim.

Overall 9
characters 8
the new characters feel like the entire story has just been
                  ...
resetted and forces you to learn new names but even so thorfinn character development is worth it
This arc 10
Farmland saga is arguably the best arc in the entire series
other than that I still recommend watching at least 5-10 episodes and if you decide its not worth it then it wont be your thing from now on.

                                      (1/2 eps)
                                   
                The Best 1 Hour of Any Pieces of Media, Ever. Period.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 3 adapt chapter 131-134 of the manga into a 1 hour movie special, and it sure feels like one.

Story 10/10
This part contain what many considered the best chapter in the manga (chapter 131) which shown the absolute true despair of the rumbling and Eren’s true motivation. And It was adapted to perfection, with many anime original scene to given more context to the situation. 

You know you are a once in a generation writer if you’re able to make the viewer feel empathetic toward someone who’s committing a
                  ...
genocide against the whole of humanity, then the next second, got us to cheers for the stopping force.

Animation 10/10
The rest of the episode also contain the best MAPPA’s animated sequence so far for their AOT, both in term of their perfection in CGI blending and 2D animation. It is safe to say that the rumbling could not been done better by any other studio, given the time and scale of it. And with this latest part, “the limiter has been taken off” - director, as he is now able to fully express his true vision for what’s MAPPA’s AOT should be. 

Sound 10/10
Perfect placement for all the OSTs in this episode, to heighten the moment even more. Also, with many sequences in particular that synced the music to the action on screen perfectly right down to the second, which is something that animation alone can’t heighten it.

Overall 10/10
It has been a long and harsh journey for this team under Mr.Hayashi-san at MAPPA, throughout all the criticisms of part 1’s animation, color, CGI, music choice, working your eyes out to save this generation-defining anime to not burn to the ground in under 8 MONTHS, just to hear harassments, and death threads, even. With the massive improvement in part 2, and now today, the team can stand proud of this achievement, in adapting what’s people thought is unadaptable, to the degree that no one would’ve thought to even picture or imagine it.

This is what peak storytelling meet peak adaptation looks like, and I’m glad to be able to witness it. Thank you Isayama, Hayashi, and MAPPA staff.

                                      (1/2 eps)
                                   
                Hajime Isayama, I have no doubt that he is a philosopher with a deep view of reality and human history, and he embodied that view in his work, as well as his knowledge of some cultures and details of our world
Isayama did not tire himself with making a world and maps for his work, but rather he made only the walls because he has a realistic view and a little bit of Far fantasy, or this is what we saw in his work, and Isayama is distinguished by his ability to stir up controversy and make the followers divide into sections, just as he did,
                  ...
and this is what we saw in the Alliance fans and the Earth Deck fans, and before that, the Marley Warriors fans and the Survey Corps soldiers fans

Attack on Titan has a great and unique style in the acceleration of events. The diversity of events, their chaos, arrangement, and strength made the work a gateway to the anime world, through which those who have never watched anime enter
In the world of literature, movies, or any artistic world, persuasion is the most important means of pleasure
Surprises are the first way to raise the value of the work or increase the enthusiasm in its events, as the writer follows this method and constructs and arranges the events to pave the way for a shocking moment that takes the work to a completely different level 

The character of eren Yeager is the window that Isayama created towards the human psyche in an attempt to understand it and realize its contradictions, mysteries, and desires.
Therefore, I see eren as the best character ever written by the Japanese if not in literature history. eren is a clear embodiment of good and evil, peace, selfishness, exclusivity, group, friendship, strength, weakness, freedom, slavery, dictatorship, and humility. He is that character who tells you that your rights are more important than the life and freedom of your enemy.
eren views life as a battle of life or death only and has no other meaning. The winner is the one who lives and the loser is the one who dies. There is no way for you to preserve your life except to fight and continue to move forward in this battle called life
We also see that the factor that made him enter history from its widest gates... is that the writer made us accept his fascist excuses for extermination. while I was influenced by eren and relatively agreed with his decisions against my will!.
but when I saw it animated and I saw Ramzy and his brother's story I finally refused extermination because what I saw was really a heartbreaking scene.
but it did not change the reality that imposes Eren as the greatest character in the history of graphic literature.
At the conclusion of the second section of the fourth season, it was hinted about eren's goal and view towards the freedom he seeks, (a world and a life that does not revolve around survival only).
he simply had 2 choices one is to follow his brother and the wall's king or two extermination of the others
He said in an episode of memories from the future (If someone tries to take away my freedom from me, I will never hesitate to take away his freedom).
This is eren's principle on his tongue, and he followed it since his childhood, and he remained until his death, and he followed that principle, but at the same time he hates it and hates that someone tries to take away his freedom, and he tries to regain it and live all his life in the same closed circle

                                      (3/2 eps)
                                   
                The pinnacle of shonen has returned. Attack On Titan will live on for generations as one of the best works of media ever made. Every new shonen since AoT's release has tried and failed to compete with the success that is Attack On Titan. no anime/show has come close to its impact in the medium for quite some time and now it's finally time to sit back and let the show take you on one final ride. I had the privilege of watching Part 3 early and I have to say MAPPA absolutely outdid themselves. While I did think AoT Final Season Part 1 had
                  ...
several animation issues, Parts 2 and 3 more than make up for it. Attack On Titan surpasses the classifications of old gen, middle gen, and new gen shonen as it staples what should be the hurdle other shonens must surpass. Every time I've watched a shonen since completing AoT, I've used it as the standard of what the shonen must be held to to be considered great. No show has even come close thus far. The phenomenal writing placed within characters like Eren, Zeke, Reiner, Erwin, Levi etc. will never cease to amaze me and Part 3 only continues to advance on their writing. 

Of course, lets gets to the meat of it. I am a manga reader ever since Season 3 so I went into Season 4 with a little more of an objective stance. I compared scenes as to how well they were adapted rather than my raw enjoyment of new content. And I believe that type of criticism is ever important with the approach of the ending. The ever controversial ending. I personally did not think it was as bad as people online made it out to be. I think the problem isn't the ending itself, but rather the show its connected to. AoT was so damn good that the ending provided was so middle of the line that it ended up being even worse than what ending set out to be. The ending itself is like a 6-7/10, including the entirety of AoT? 5/10 or lower. I do strongly believe the ending will be better adding animation, voice acting, color etc. But it's something we will have to look forward to in Part 3 Part 2. Part 3 Part 1 was a fantastic addition to the series and the famous scenes involved in this part are done to perfection. I am trying to be as transparent as possible to avoid spoilers but I promise you it is really damn good.

It saddens me that people unironically think AoT is not a good show when it is the closest thing to being objectively a good one as subjectiveness goes. I've rarely ever seen a show, before or after, my viewing of AoT that even came close to my enjoyment and fascination of a series like AoT has. Attack On Titan sits on the throne of shonen and will remain there in my personal opinion for quite a long damn time.

EditSynopsisAs peace returns to the demon realm, Anos Voldigoad wishes nothing more than to put his reputation as the Demon King of Tyranny to rest and go back to being a misfit at the prestigious Demon King Academy. Unfortunately, any tranquility is fleeting: sinister demons, kings, and deities plot Anos's demise from the shadows.

Rumors spread about the ""Child of God,"" a being whose power may rival that of Anos. To uncover the truth and eliminate the potential threat, Anos must journey deep into the land of spirits. However, the spirit world is shrouded in mystery, and it may only be entered after undergoing a series of difficult trials.

With unrivaled power and confidence, Anos braces himself to defeat various formidable enemies with grandiose titles. But he—with the assistance of his trusted allies—will barely have to break a sweat as the true Demon King of Tyranny.

                                      (3/? eps)
                                   
                What happens when the author, producer and greedy executives want more money from a series that completed its story? They make a good anime/story and forcefully extend it to the point of ridiculousness full of convoluted BS and pathetic villain's. They Boruto it. 

My first gripe is the MC voice changed. what the VA did was horrible but did not warrant the change. The new VA while good does not match the MC charisma/attitude. Go to season one listen to the VA for the MC from season one and compare with the new one. The second VA voice does not match what the MC should
                  ...
sound like. It literally throws off anyone who actually watch season one. The tone and pitch of two are also so different. If you are going to change VA why not try and match someone who sounds like the previous VA?

All these female characters all fawning and whoring themselves over the MC is annoy as hell and provide no actual character growth. Literally first season gave all the reason why; there was no point in having a second season to try and prove why they are fawning over him over and over again. The point is overblown and overused. At this point they might as well be in an orgy and might as well throw in some random goblins and have the MC wear a suit of armor because thats how bad the situation is right now. If these characters could hear what the MC sounds like in season 1 and in season 2 they would all just wonder if this was Goblin Slayer or if this was actually the misfit of the demon king.

in conclusion. MC VA change was horrible. Extending the show and novel/manga was a money grab so far up in the ass that everyone that expects this to be good will be disappointed because it will be a shit show just like boruto.

                I watched and loved s1, and though I can't quite remember what about s1 did it for me, I can say with confidence that s2 lacks any and all of whatever made its predecessor good. I feel like s2 jumps around a lot, and the story/events are hard to follow. Chekov's Gun is a great writing tool, and s2 doesn't use it at all; drop a couple hints that something is gonna happen before it happens, otherwise it feels completely out of left field. Overall, s2 feels cheap and unnecessary, and I wish s1 had been the end if this is what a continuation looks
                  ...
like.

Mixed FeelingsPreliminary
                
                                      (4/? eps)
                                   
                I dont know i just said it pure my opinion and how i feel about the show. First, Character is like jojo for some kind reason, they copy all jojo like character with big muscle and talk with very loud noise is kinda annoying for me, character also feel like so generic, nothing stand out especially new character introduce in S2, character in S2 just there to make plot move, nothing really invest right here, also dont forget that main cast of this anime feel like noone, they are just appear there, talk a single word then move on to mc, thats all. Second because
                  ...
character S2 kinda generic, also plot kinda generic, plot is mess up everywhere, leftover without answer (i watch till episode 4, this is how i feel, probably the answer later episode but i just point out whats wrong here, so dont judge me). Third, this is season 2, it should be at least 1 or 2 episode aftermath, something like  that, but nah, they just immediately jump to conflict again which confuse me really hard, first episode, its FLASHBACK, who begin first episode of anime with half of flashback, second episode, its back to school then suddenly getting attack by group, i mean why the hell they do that, No Conclusion or just calm before storm thing, they just jump to conflict in very early episode.

Conclusion, its hard to watch for me, feel overwhelming with everything, it should at least calm before storm thing first then u can jump to conflict again, and then didnt like how S2 character feel like jojo character in other way.

Again, its my opinion, i will continue watch and see what happened, i put it Mixed Feeling, reason? i like this anime but i dont like how s2 run so far

EditSynopsisIn spite of his best time-leaping efforts, Takemichi Hanagaki continuously fails to prevent the present-day death of Hinata Tachibana, his adolescent love. The adult Takemichi grapples with grief and the ramifications of the Tokyo Manji gang's criminal empire—an unintended product of his timeline meddling. Though the gang once operated under the idealistic Manjirou ""Mikey"" Sano, it has now been taken over by the malicious Tetta Kisaki and, as a result, has abandoned its original optimistic intent.

Despite feeling hopeless, Takemichi travels to the past once again to investigate Black Dragon, a rival motorcycle gang whose actions ultimately lead to Hinata's demise. There, he meets the young Hakkai Shiba, a fellow gang member whose older brother, Taiju, tyrannically rules Black Dragon. When Taiju brutally beats Takemichi in a one-sided street brawl, Hakkai attempts to withdraw from Tokyo Manji in apology—an act that Takemichi must prevent to spare Hakkai a grim future.

Through a shared tragedy, Takemichi bonds with Chifuyu Matsuno, establishing a close comradery both boys desperately need. With Chifuyu on his side, Takemichi works to unravel the fates of Black Dragon's members, fighting to create a happy future for his loved ones.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundTokyo Revengers: Seiya Kessen-hen was released on Blu-ray and DVD in three volumes from March 15, 2023, to May 24, 2023.

                                      (3/13 eps)
                                   
                So, I am not a manga reader, so do not know too much about the Tokyo Revengers manga. However, during season One I felt something about the whole thing. I felt like the story tries to show me something that is a shounen but goes 180 degrees to a different location. Well, It is, but unfortunately, it is not a good thing.


Even though the fact, that first season even had some flaws, for me, neither Takemitchy nor the Tokyo Manji Gang was not irritating. I loved the way that Takemitchy tried to show for spectators, despite his Rivercrying no Jutsu... And was kinda exaggerated but
                  ...
Manji gang was okay. Yep, it has some questions about the Gang but for me was a nice group that was only for Takemitchy's development (at least for a while) and supported the story. Well, after a year off I have to admit, this story is a big bulls**t. I am sorry but this is nonsense promiscuity. 

As I wrote a bit upper, never have I ever read the manga and did not know the manga of Tokyo Revengers is a neverending shounen prototype. Probably it sounds not a big deal but it is. For me, even the Season One worked only because of the (questionable) character development of the Protagonist. But doing this stupid time travel without a good point is simply ridiculous.

Unfortunately, the Second season does not help at all. So far, this season is unambiguously awful. The whole story started to get confusedly mixed up and the whole happenings were just irrelevant. And I can not even say the new storyline is bad because it does not even exist. The second season so far wants to show the result of a problem (with probably Mikey) that WE DO NOT KNOW. 

Also, episode by episode I am getting irritated slowly by Takemitchy. Since the Middle of the first season, his development is non-existent. Probably this is why I can not recommend this anime right now because people mocked Takemitchy as he was a crybaby, but I was never get irritated by him. Until the first episode of this season. 

For me, personally, with this neverending style this story does not work, this concept can not be coherent to be a longer story. After this first bigger part starts to stagger in the aspect of coherency.

I am sorry but this whole Tokyo Revengers turns into a really deep mess. TR Second Season yet is a pointless irrelevant promiscuity, with an undetailed story that (I think) should not even, come this far(at least not in this way).

                                  Spoiler 
                This post contain a spoiler of why I don't recommend and dropped the show.



This season is far weaker than season one, which was good/ok, but I really enjoyed the characters like Draken, Mickey, Chifuyu, Baji and even takemichi who wasn't the best of the main characters, but i've seen worst who really got there redemption though the story, the time travel thing and the tradegy was really good, and the most important thing I really love hating Kazutora and Kisaki. 
Then season 2 came, the pace change, everyone seens to bedumbier than season one, the villain doesn't have charisma like Kisaki and seens to be
                  ...
tottaly empty only being evil for being evil, even tho i kept watching, till episode five. Hinata Tachibana was by far the best thing in this series, seeing her death scenes in the future really hit me hard and seeing how she always look up to Takemichi and there friends even if they are not really a good example or are in great danger, she is always there, and then Takemichi break up with her only BECAUSE HER FATHER ASKED HIM TO, even after all they've been though, that's the peak of dumbinnes and I just can't take it anymore, she was really the greatest reason of everything since the first episode, and only because of her father they break up, it doesn't make any sense, this is terrible! I heard many friends, who read the manga saying it gets really bad and I really though ""it can't be that bad, maybe they just don't like time travel theme or something like that"". But that's it, everything the show proposes has just been though away by one single fact as Takemichi specially, and some others, get dumbier evey single episode. Bad, really bad.

                This anime is too imposing, the writer doesn't really understand the situation that happened in the anime, it's unrealistic in writing the story. especially the main character has no resistance at all in the fight. I feel the story really doesn't make sense for an anime of this genre. the main character is always giving lectures without being able to fight at all. Moreover, this anime in season 2 becomes even more long-winded. in terms of animation is also bad. don't try to watch instead of wasting your time.

the story is really bad
the art style is bad but not really
unrealistic character
the character reacts but does
                  ...
not take action
I don't think anyone will like it story-wise

EditSynopsisHayase Nagatoro and Naoto Hachiouji have grown closer: the girl spends more time than ever in the art club room with her senpai. Although he is always on edge, Naoto no longer seems to mind Nagatoro's presence. Time and again, Naoto demonstrates his hidden, cool demeanor, and Nagatoro displays her possessive tendencies. However, they still can not seem to completely close the distance between them. It is clear to everyone else that the pair have feelings for each other.

For Nagatoro, there is nothing more entertaining than toying with Naoto. But as the girl shows no plans to stop teasing her senpai, it is only a matter of time before they realize how they truly feel.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundIjiranaide, Nagatoro-san 2nd Attack was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from March 8, 2023 to June 7, 2023.

                                      (5/12 eps)
                                   
                My favorite Anime airing this season. Good old nagatoro, now let me ask you this have you ever wanted a cute chick to just toy with you ? most likely not! I stopped watching anime a while ago when nagatoro season 1 was airing. So i never finished it and didn't bother to, i have read 4 vols of nagatoro as well. But  3 days ago  after watching my friends review over on his youtube channel about This anime for some reason i really liked this video, he made something about it which just really well done. This video made me go out
                  ...
of my way to finished season 1 of Nagatoro. i was on (ep 3), and at the end of the night, I was done with the first season and started season 2. Im now on the current ep which is (ep 5) And i just got to say this anime is awesome. It was just as my buddy said it was. When you finish that ep you just want to keep going and going seeing these 2 Character become closer. I've seen lots of animes but this anime has really drawn me in these 2 characters life, and boy let me tell you i just went and got all the rest of the manga series that is out in english and pre order 1. Can't wait for the next Ep check it out and i hope you feel the same.

                It's just a big improvement over already a great show. It's cute, silly and just really entertaining to watch. I love how their relationship is actually going somewhere and throughout the season they are growing to acknowledge their feelings for one another. If you didn't like the first season don't even bother watching this anime because it's the same formula in every single episode. But if you did enjoy the first season I can guarantee that you will fall in love with the 2nd attack. Although I really like the 2nd season It's far from perfect series. Whole plot is pretty generic, if you watched
                  ...
some romance anime before you might get that cliché felling from all those places. For example episode about winter trip or new year. Of course I'm not trying to say that it was unfun to watch but just want to notice that show as big as Don't Mess with Me Nagatoro should be at least somehow different from any typical romanse. But despite taking some easy paths Nagatoro is still really enjoyable and It's most definitely living up to the hype around it.

                So far a very promising season

If you enjoyed the first season I believe you will like this second season a lot better as the main duo is really hitting their stride and making great progress as characters.  Nagatoro-san does a great job of making you care about the characters and their development.  Senpai or Naoto is gaining more confidence in himself and is realizing that if he wants to actually make things work with Nagatoro he needs to be the one to make a change in how he acts.  He is going to continue to develop as a character and I can't
                  ...
wait to see how it will all come to fruition.  Unlike a certain beta cuck protagonist *cough* *cough* rent a girlfriend.  While they both are extremely shy about their true feelings, they both know that they have genuine feelings for one another creating such wholesome and cute moments.  There is not much home to write about as if you enjoyed the first season you're not going to be disappointed with this one.  GO WATCH IT NOW.

                                      (3/? eps)
                                   
                Played NieR: Automata and NieR Replicant 2 years ago and I have to say this looks amazing.


This masterpiece is the ultimate humanist fable. It makes you wonder what it really means to be human, what are the things humans do or have that makes them human and that the androids and machines lack, why do they kill machines if the two are fundamentally the same, Are those really emotions that the machines are expressing, or are they just just imitations?


The story gets very tragic at some point (by the beginning of C route for those who have played it). It has beautiful narrative style and
                  ...
meaning with very well written characters that will get you attached to them (9S for me personally). You'll see.

I just hope NieR Replicant gets an anime adaptation next because it's almost as amazing as NieR: Automata. It's sad how it gets overshadowed by its 2017 sequel.

I'd recommand just playing the game really you'll be amazed (and don't you forget Replicant!) because the fighting scenes, action and felt emotions are really meant to be experienced first hand and not as spectator, but if you can't or dont want to, you're definitely missing out.

The opening and ending are amazing and I like how they didn't change the game's OSTs and kept them intact in this adaptation. The bonus with the puppets is also cool. The adaptation also has anime specials only based off live concerts of the game and such. 

As for the visuals they're pretty enjoyable, unlike what others might say, but we all know how toxic this community is and animation is always the subject of criticism for a lot of popular new anime. Take Chainsaw Man for example. CSM had great CGI (a lot better than NieR: Automata) AND great 2d animation, but people still found a way to brag about it. NieR's CGI looked rough in some scenes, but that was really just because of the detailed mecha models and the shading, but we are going to see less of these in the future so it's fine and shouldn't be the subject of hard criticism.

Guess this turned out more like a review of the game and not just where the anime is for now, but oh well... My global rating and opinion of it might change in the future because it's still airing.

                                      (3/? eps)
                                   
                I do feel like it's a bit hard to really rate NieR as an anime product, when as per normal, Game adaptations are normally hit or miss. But in the case of NieR, instead of being a title that either not many know, or it isn't as widely regarded. In NieR's case, they're not only well established in the gaming world, but they're well loved too. For it's deep story, characters, and many plot points that really hit you deep in the feels. It's as if NieR breaks that mold of 'OK' or 'not good' game stories, as it's a story that is well received,
                  ...
and long as it's translated well into an anime setting, will help drive it forward in the long run.

Despite that however, I would say to still play and experience the games first hand. While the anime stands on it's own feet in it's own right, the game will for sure stand more so. Which isn't a negative, more that the anime itself, will sell itself to new viewers of the series,to sell the game and it's world to them, to be enjoyed and experienced for all.

Story and characters: 8
What NieR has, as the drive to see more, to wonder more, when it comes to the characters, world building, and it's story. They could introduce you, to the most random of character, but the writing is so good and strong, by the end of it, you would've cared for the character, and wanted them to succeed. That's how good the quality of writing is. 

We're set in the far future, where humanity has fled to the moon, or most of what was left of it. Leaving most androids among other machine like beings to roam it, and settle their own differences, mostly through battles of combat, and much more. I don't wanna go into touch detail, as honestly the main selling point of NieR and it's story, is to experience it first hand. Rather than reading through a review for it. As NieR will make you sad, it'll make you feel happy, a game that can do that, is a game worth playing, and if it translates well into anime form, then it'll do te same here.

Art and sound: 8
I don't see the big issue here honestly. No matter how certain things look, when it's put in certain lightning, it really fits in so well with the overall product, that it looks fine in general. The style itself on the other hand, really fits the themes of the show. With it being set in a very devastating future, that to the point, it's a wonder how there is even life around these parts. You really feel the sense of dread, and lack of life. With a good quality of sound in order to match that up and more so. Smoothly animated, and good looking for it's themes. Great stuff.

NieR is a good adaptation of it's source material, of which that you should not only be watching, but also playing. If you enjoy this, I would go and download NieR and play it. Much like I would recommend this.

                                      (3/? eps)
                                   
                NieR: Automata, is one of the best games that has been released. If you have played through it, you know 100% what I am talking about and how deep the story of the game goes. It is no surprise to us that A-1 Pictures picking up this masterpiece, would be this good.
I cannot express enough on how much the game had an impact in my life when I finished it. And after 6 years, here I am writing a review on an anime adaptation that I never dreamt would be possible.

Story: 10 (Masterpiece)
As I said before, there is no surprise that the story that the
                  ...
infamous Yoko Taro built is very close to perfection. The world building mixed in with the creativity of the mistery of what is happening in it, makes you uneasy to the point where some times you stop just to ask yourself ""What is being alive?"". Without spoiling much, I can only tell you that from episode 3 forward, things will get really interesting to the point where I'm sure you just want to know what will happen next episode.

Adaptation: 9.5 (Masterpiece)
I'm a big fan of the whole Nier universe, and to be honest, I think the adaptation is very close to perfection. The references, the music, the voice acting, the characters emotions... I feel like it's way too good to be true sometimes. If you see people that are ""fans"" of the game, start arguing on how the adaptation is bad because ""They skipped 2 hours of gameplay"" ignore them. First of all, it is a lie since the adaptation of a game that has 21 hours of main objectives and 40 more hours to complete the rest of the game, you wouldn't expect them to drag the anime for 180 episodes(roughly 60 hours) just to show you details of the game, so they mostly show you small references on what happens on various routes the game and the main plot (which again, to me just makes sense).
They even animated 2B's ladder climb, what a legendary studio.

Sound: 10 (Masterpiece)
The opening is a banger, Aimer was a great choice on this one. The theme ""Escalate"" is really touching. I've been listening to this music nonstop since ep 1 was released, and to be honest, if you end the anime or played the game, the song's lyrics reflect perfectly what Nier: Automata is all about.
Voice acting, soundracks from the game, Ufotable level sound desing. I cannot explain further. You willcry on some of the soundtracks.

Characters: 9.5 (Great piece)
Their emotions, theit lines, the way they interact with each other, it is so unique that you 100% won't ever see anything like this again. The love that you build for the characters the more the time passes by, it's perfect. The introduction of new characters in the anime feel very refreshing compared to the game where at the start you are bombarded with information. This might be me since I know the story already, but I think it is at least more understandable now since there are not too many text boxes to read and a lot of characters to know the name from the get go. 

Animation: 9 (Great)
Don't let others fool you by saying the CG is bad in this anime, surely they didn't watch overlord or Berserk remake. To make the CG perfect, they would have needed to make a colab with studio Orange. People need to start thinking that there are some studios that are way too 2D focused to have a team make the 2 second CG for episode. This is no Violet Evergarden, but going through the trouble of animating the sequences perfectly aligned with the game ""map"", I just gotta clap and say ""thank you"". To me this is the best animation A-1 Pictures has put out yet.

Enjoyment: 10 (Masterpiece)
I'm enjoying this anime very much, 100% my favourite anime of the season and probably will be of the year as well if everything continues on like this. If you are a fan of the game and you are not enjoying this as much as I am, it's fine. Everyone enjoys anime in a different way. I ask you don't go out of your way to write false claims about the game ""that you played"", just to ruin the experience for viewers that didn't play the game.

Final Score: 9.66
As my final words, this is a very enjoyable show with lots of things too look into. Theories of mysteries yet to be solved, characters that are much more puzzling that meets the eye, feelings for robots that wou would never thought you would have, and much more.
As a hint for the people that are new to this, I highly recommend you to play the game before watching the anime, but either way it is very enjoyable nonetheless.

EditSynopsisChildhood friends Tomo Aizawa and Junichirou ""Jun"" Kubota do everything together, whether it be training or just enjoying a fun day out. Anyone would think that these two are best friends for life. The only issue is that the tomboyish Tomo is in love with Jun, but he regards her like a brother.

At the start of their first year of high school, Tomo confesses her feelings to Jun. However, her rough mannerisms and lack of hesitance to throw a punch do nothing to sway Jun's heart. Realizing that he will remain indifferent to her affections unless she does something about it, Tomo must find a way to knock some sense into Jun and open his eyes to what is right in front of him.

                                      (4/13 eps)
                                   
                To give an updated review - My first review was for the first three episodes I just watched the 5th episode. I still stand by my complaints below. That being said, it's because of Carol and Carol alone that I will raise the show from a 5 to a 6. 

Here is my original review.......

I was looking forward to this anime, because I thought it had an interesting plot and the trailer made it seem fun to watch. However, as of episode 3, I'm struggling to force my way to continue watching it. All the characters come off very flat. Every character besides Tomo is
                  ...
one-dimensional. 

That's not to say that the characters don't have personalities or that they can't be charming in their own way...........but it's very, very, very shallow. There's almost zero back story or character development in this show. The show essentially tries to cover this by a few lines of dialogue between the characters, and it really does it in an forced way as if the show is just trying to push the plot forward while giving the absolute least amount of time and detail to it. 

Tomo does try to be girly a couple different times, but it just feels like an after-thought than anything of substance. This is not a new idea in the world of anime, that a girl will try to be more ""girly"", but in this show it just tries to address the situation and cover it in the most bland and quick way possible.....as if to check the box on the list(which seems to be a common situation).

 Her best friend has a monotone attitude, which really bogs the anime down even further. I have no problem with monotone characters if they are done well(such as Android 18 in Dbz), but this is a clear miss. Tomo's boring best friend having so much of the spotlight diverts attention or focus away from digging deeper into the overall story and/or ""potentially interesting"" characters. 

I really don't know what this anime is striving to be........romance? because the direction and attempts for it seems very uninteresting. Funny? Aside for Carol, it's definitely nonexistent. I suppose the lack of lives of the characters outside of school seriously hampers the ""world setting"" and makes the characters less deep than what they already are. 

Tomo, herself, is a classic violent tsundere who is prone to violence against the boy of her interest, even when not deserved. Where have you read/heard that before? Even if you don't mind that cliche, there are TONS of girls in animes that are much more entertaining, intriguing, developed, and memorable. 

Aside for Carol(who is a minor character), this show is..........worst of all........boring. If you need to kill some time, with a much  better newer anime, go check out Sugar Apple Fairy(I promise it's better than the name makes it out to be).

Mixed FeelingsPreliminary
                
                                      (4/13 eps)
                                   
                this anime is just fine. the tomboy thing is a nice addition to the waifu anime trend. but there is a big problem in this show : Misuzu.

she's the cold ""friend"" who looks cool and all. she might have a reason for being this cold with everyone. but she's also mean. like really mean, for no reason, and therefore, not cool at all. and EVERYONE (and i mean everyone in the show AND everyone watching the show) seem to like this f**kin b*tch. i don't get it.

in episode 5, we meet Carol's mother, who is Carol but taller, with shorter hair and a stronger accent.
                  ...
as soon as Misuzu enters the house and is greeted, Carol notices they have similar hairstyles. Misuzu QUICKLY gets her hair down so they don't look alike. i see that as a ""yuck, i don't wanna resemble this idiot"". and after that, she's just mean like in every episode, but gets called out by Carol's mother ! and as soon as she has the opportunity to apologize, she just acts rude again to the mother. and the mother is like ""oh she so cute"" like wtf is going on ??? and anyone getting insulted by this girl is like ""she's so cool"", like they like it or don't see how bad that person is. if i were the mother i would've kicked her out already. but then Misuzu feels awkward so she urges Tomo, her best friend, to get out of there.

then we meet Misuzu's mother, and she's cold too. but cool ! she's not mean for nothing. Misuzu would be likeable if she was cold and cool like her mother, but she's just cold. and mean.

everytime she's mean, we hear her inner voice saying things like ""why do i feel this ? why do i feel like i lost ?"" like being the b*tch she is is an actual game. Misuzu: The B*tch: The Game.

people who are mean for NO reason, or those who think it's a game, are garbage. and she's both.


that girl aside, any other character has their own little trait but that's it, no development. i HOPE the next episodes will explain stuff because i just can't get why everyone like that horrible character, but if she stays like this and doesn't die at the end, i don't know why i'm watching.


oh damn, it was supposed to be about a masculine girl being in love with her childhood friend. how can side characters that are THIS BAD take the whole attention ?

5/10 for now

Mixed FeelingsPreliminary
                
                                      (4/13 eps)
                                   
                The typical anime where the secondary characters are much more interesting than the main characters.

I didn't like the humor and it ended up becoming a boring comedy. Jun is annoying, Tomo screams every two seconds and everything turns to aggression. Misuzu loading the storie! I had high expectations in the first episode, but the others were very slow, it must be another anime that goes in a circle and does not get anywhere.


The blonde character (I forgot the name) is also interesting, she and Misuzu make a great duo. Them together on screen is more exciting to watch than Jun and Tomo screaming to hit
                  ...
each other.

                                      (3/13 eps)
                                   
                At long last, we finally get another season of this superb series. Fans of the series will be pleased, that it not only looks like it hasn't missed a beat. But also, if I'm honest. It looks better than ever. You can seriously tell, the care to detail in so many areas, the presentation, how things transition. It's all done so well, and it'll make any fan of this series happy, while making any potential new fans, want to be invested in it's product. It's tense, it's creative, it does it's job and more so.

Story and characters: 9
I will say to avoid spoilers, that fans
                  ...
will know why this is the start of the series, they'll understand how and why it's starting off like so. But I'd honestly say on that front, in credit to the story and it's contents. It really creates such an intense and thrilling atmosphere, that it'll draw any kind of person in. If you're watching it for the first time, it'll be enjoyable even to you. They really nailed the core setting down, like a play funny enough. Setting the perfect scene, and getting you invested from the gt go.

That's not just down to the story too. The characters that you witness really draw you in.They're got a confident aura about them. The sort that'll keep you not only entertained, but appreciate them more. An anime does things right, when they nail on this kind of attention to detail. A story can be good, but if the characters are bland as all hell, then it won't be entertaining, but here, it's enough to make anyone want to see more, and go back to see the older seasons.

Art and sound: 9
Honestly, the way they pull this off, is not only super creative, but the style of it all. Just works so well with how tense the show is. The way things transition, while still remaining in a good tone that drives it forward. Not leaving you feel out of touch by going in any weird directions, and making you less interested. The art, and sound blend together perfectly, to paint the picture of a great looking and sounding product. Where it be in black and white, or in full colour.


Bungou's 4th season has kicked off with a bang, and looks as good as the previews showed it would be. A must watch, and a must enjoy for sure. If you're new to this series, I'd recommend either going over the manga, or novels, or watch the previous seasons as well. As if you enjoy this, you'll enjoy those too.

                                      (4/13 eps)
                                   
                The only reason that I have not given these first few preliminary episodes a 10/10 is because they are just that, preliminary. If Stray Dogs Season 4 continues to perform at the level that it is, and follows the content and writing quality of the manga chapters it is currently adapting, a 10/10 will be a no brainer in the near future. The upcoming arc is easily one of best, if not the peak arcs of the series, and if I'm being honest, I was initially annoyed that Season 4 started with another flashback arc because I was so eager to see the adaptation of
                  ...
the coming manga arc.
My expectations, however, was blown away. The foreshadowing, dynamics and writing, even within the few characters that reared their head in the first three episodes was just absolutely spectacular. Showing the advanced capabilities of even a young Ranpo, along with setting the seeds for the dynamics between Fukuchi and Fukuzawa is just a perfect way to ease viewers back into the series that has not released episodes in years.
Now that the first episode of the new arc has aired, along with the OP and ED, I can comfortably say that my sky high expectations of the series, have been exceeded even further. The animation quality, sound, music, characters and everything are displayed just as I dreamed. If you have stuck around with the series this long, the payoff is now, and if you are thinking about starting it, I can confidently say it is worth it.

dont understand why this isnt being watched more and topping the seasona charts an incredile prequeal begining into a equally great story line with a large in depth look at what an amazing chracter rampo is .  cannot get enough.

unique story in every way
art style is beautiful and personally one of my favorites
amazing character cast at the agency so well rounded you can hardly tell who is the protaganist
the show has a mature feeling with realistic interactions and characters when it really needs it
i cannot imagine someone not enjoying this series

not finished yet so 9/10 for now but if it continues 10/10

EditSynopsisAfter achieving fruitful results in New World Online's previous events, the now famous Maple Tree guild is excited to explore the new floors introduced in game. As if their guild was not already feared enough, each member is motivated to find stronger skills for themselves in order to greatly expand their options in future battles. Not forgetting the importance of networking, the guild also forges amicable relationships with other notable guilds, such as the Kingdom of the Flame Emperor and the Congregation of the Holy Swords.

With their eccentric guild master Maple at the forefront, the members of Maple Tree continue to stumble upon creative ways to implement their skills, driving the game developers crazy along the way.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                The second season of this show has moved on from ""Accidentally get OP"" to ""Make the devs cry"". New updates keep coming out, and the devs, rather than try balancing their game properly, decide to keep piling on more and more unique skills with each expansion, then marveling them Maple inevitably uses them to beat their newest boss. There are only so many times you can hear ""Oh, we must balance the game. But then if we balance the game then it'll REALLY be unbalanced."" before you throw your hands up and give up on this shit-show of a premise. 

Half of the issues revolve
                  ...
around the fact that they have no minimum level requirements, so a dedicated tank can use high DPS attacks and abilities without issue. Another quarter of the issues revolve around the fact that there seems to be no actual drawback to just busting out your best stuff immediately. Hell, she'll regularly go from busted flying AOE form to busted monster form in the span of minutes! It really makes you wonder why they even have a DPS in their guild (because, yes, they have glass cannons in their guild). Everyone just may as well go full tank and be done with it. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the skills she's getting seem to be unique. That is to say, it looks like nobody else can get them after her! 

Finally, the devs just leave in a bunch of stupid oversights, like Telekinesis not being able to move people, but then it's magically fine if you move something that's carrying them instead. Low move speed? Just hop on your shield and yeet yourself around. Feeling tired of yeeting yourself around? Summon a turtle and ride on its back. Tired of turtles? Ask a friend to carry you! Why have actual mounts in the game when you can just make everything a mount in the first place and avoid paying a price for dumping literally all your points into a single stat?! 

There are other issues, like the fact that the stakes and figures are never really clear, so every fight you just watch people do a thing and then it either instantly kills the enemy (bosses included), or it doesn't work. There are no numbers to ground the fight in anything, so you're just watching an abstract spectacle where it feels like everything lives and dies according to what's convenient for the story.

Yes, that's how all fights in stories go, but this one doesn't even try to sell us on them.

Mixed FeelingsPreliminary
                
                                      (6/12 eps)
                                   
                I can see myself enjoying NWO if the game actually exist, even though in the current anime that game seems very unbalanced. Starting from status debuff stacks to no end (like Maple's poison) to the activating magic preemptively and using it as much as you like later. All sounds unbalanced, but it seems fun. And that's, what i think is the main selling point.

Its story is just a heartwarming group of friends (especially maple and sally), grinding and exploring together. While Sally is a 'pro gamer', thinking everything thoroughly, Maple is just a braindead player who think ""This might be cool!"" and do whatever she
                  ...
wants. 2 opposite sides, having fun together, day in and day out. I think this series is not about heavy action or cool pro gamer moves, and more into slice-of-life type anime where you see them doing whatever they wants.

The main downside probably is ""How to understand the mechanics of NWO"", since there's a lot of things left unexplained ever since season 1. For example, how does Machine God or that demon-transforming skill actually works? can you use another skill in that form? Does poison damage stacks? Is there a limit, like, anywhere? There's a lot of things unexplained that sometimes its frustating.

But if you just shut your brain off, ignore everything, and enjoying the Maple Tree Guild interaction, this anime is still fine and you might enjoy it.

EditSynopsisMahiru Shiina is worthy of her nickname ""Angel"": she is a divine beauty loved by all, and she excels in both academics and athletics. Shiina lives in an entirely different world from Amane Fujimiya, her next-door neighbor. Despite living so close together, they have never spoken once. But their silence is broken when Fujimiya spots Shiina gloomily sitting on a swing amidst a heavy rainstorm and lends her his umbrella. 

When Fujimiya catches a cold the next day, Shiina wishes to return the favor for the umbrella by nursing him back to health. Believing that this would be their first and last interaction, he silently appreciates her kindness. However, Shiina—who can not help but worry about Fujimiya's lack of tidiness and proper nutrition—begins to cook and clean for him. As the unlikely pair spend time together in Fujimiya's apartment, they explore the true nature of their relationship and the gentle emotions that emerge from it.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                The Angel Next Door presents only two characters with identifiable traits: a generic male protagonist named Amane, and Mahiru, a girl similar to Tsukasa from Tonikawa Over the Moon for You. For no good reason, she becomes protective of Amane, but his name does not matter since he is an avatar for the audience. He is devoid of traits so that anyone with a similar fantasy can project onto him. Sometimes, monotonous characters lacking personality can develop and become more fleshed out. As of the third episode, there has yet to be character growth.

Even for those who find this sort of escapism appealing, there’s nothing
                  ...
that elevates this above its contemporaries. For a production of this middling caliber, it’s no shock there’s not much animation, and the background art lacks detail. You’ll recognize the generic character designs if you’ve watched studio Project No. 9’s other tv series, such as HigeHiro and Tomozaki-kun. Excluding Inukai-san’s Dog, this has the laziest opening and ending visuals I’ve seen all season. The songs are fine—generic—but the visuals are simply reused footage, panning shots of Mahiru, and slideshow animation.

For anyone who’s seen this premise done before, you’ll know the generic male fantasy makes for a pretty dull story. All the steps are predictable; Mahiru takes care of Amane in every episode, then they develop feelings for each other. It tries to be simpler than most unbelievable fantasies, which may give the impression that it’s classier—there’s no comedy, melodrama, or fan service. It’s like unsalted chips: Flavorless junk food entertainment.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                While ignoring previously released anime, I usually keep myself entertained with the medium through the seasonal romances. Sadly I can't watch them all, so I have to choose only a few based on the synopsis and possible manga responses. The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten didn't exactly pique my interest fully, but I decided to give it a go nonetheless. Safe to say it's a perfectly fine show that ticks all the boxes for the romance addicts like myself to be satisfying and watchable. However, if you are looking for an experience superior to other romance shows then move along and find something else,
                  ...
because this generic romcom is nothing special. 

A common trend nowadays with the (sub)genre is an episodic format of shorts compacted into a single episode. These 8-12 minute long chapters focus on various interactions between the lead duo. The girl is usually attractive, gawked at by those around her and is outwardly flawless, only for it to be a façade to lock up her insecure ""bad"" traits. Accompanying her is a bland, background boy with indistinguishable characteristics who shares the same design as every male lead ever. Clearly this caters to the male fantasy I bet a lot of the viewers have, the male being their surrogate so they can lust over the new seasonal waifu. Any taste of identifiable differences would risk losing that connection between the average male viewer and the male lead. But what's surprising here is that the male and female lead interact and treat each other as equals - one is clearly more successful with school, social life, and responsibilities though- and what's no shock is that they're both shallow characters. Like egg shells, it seems there's no filling, with their outsides cracked and no hope of repair. It's been 3 episodes sure, but I've yet to see anything unique about either of them besides the typical archetypes I explained earlier, and no pathway revealed to guess how they will form. The foundation setup being Shiina visiting to cook confuses me. She reasons with her passion for the activity, but then she goes ahead and cleans his apartment too? I guess her façade led to some isolation, which we get some hints at, but to partake in unrequired chores for another's house isn't the best way to start. The cooking alone would've been fine as that's the focus mostly, which also aids bonding the 2 together, so I don't see the unnecessary extra tasks having reason. Fortunately the show doesn't glue to their neighbouring flats, and occasionally flicks to their school - something I hope they continue doing more regularly - where they vowed to hide their knowledge of each other. Their pseudo-friendship slowly blossoms into an authentic one, and it's appealing to see Fujimiya struggle to conceal the girl's identity when in question. 
The voice actors of the 2 are unknown to me, but I can comfortably claim that Iwami's work here is excellent. It boasts confidence without reaching arrogance, she understands the limits of the character without being theatrical. Honestly it's some of the best this season despite how monotonous it may appear to be; it's the subtle nuances that show the talent present that impresses me the most. 

Interestingly, the visuals are akin to classic romances mixed with modern quality animation. Think of mid 2000s art that is synonymous with the period, whilst still fitting with now and you'd get the style used in this. Oddly it works, and leaks some nostalgic allure that effortlessly attracts me. In a way it's kind of refreshing, but it's not enough to fully travel me back to the home era, sadly. I won't bother mentioning the music - it's nothing special and the OP/ED are both mediocre, perhaps decent upon familiarity. 

I wouldn't say I've completely despaired over the show. It's apparent it will be a slower paced tale, which is fine if there was actually any meaningful content. Until I see said content, I'm left vastly underwhelmed and cannot give it my recommendation. If you embrace the genre like I do, then I'm sure there's some fun to snack on. For those who are indifferent with the romcom scene, I would skip this one for now.

Mixed FeelingsPreliminary
                
                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                As a hardcore fan of the light novel I am slightly disappointed with this anime. 
The greatest part of the light novel was how it went at a nice slow pacing to build of the relationship between the two main leads.
A lot of in story time has pasted since they meet and to where the story is by volume 4. 
The anime is adapted around 5 chapters per episode when in my opinion it should be more around 2-3 chapters per episode.
Another problem I have with this show is the studio making it Project No.9. The light novels art by Hanekoto is breathtaking while Project
                  ...
No.9 is just bad and just look flat.
The light novel is slow and is mostly just the characters talking which works well as a book it does not translate well into a tv show and it just feels dull as you watch barely animated characters talking, *cough* *cough* Project No.9.*cough* *cough*
Overall the style and vibe that made me fall in love with this light novel as been sucked out of the anime making a shell of what it could have been.
To put my thoughts best in to words ""I'm not mad just disappointed.""

EditSynopsisOn Christmas Eve, four-year-old Miri Unasaka arrives in Tokyo completely alone, in search of her father. The bright lights and merry atmosphere guide Miri to a big hotel and a man with a delicious-looking cake. However, the child has just unknowingly walked into the center of an elaborate, foolproof plan for assassinating a dangerous mafia boss.

Professional assassins Kazuki Kurusu and Rei Suwa live together, fleeing memories of their grim childhoods and avoiding emotional connections. When their mission goes awry and they end up bringing Miri home, there is only one reasonable thing to do: return Miri to her mother. But the girl's innocent laugh and pure worldview quickly enamor her to Kazuki, who secretly enjoys playing a parent, and it is not long before Rei's impenetrable heart makes room for Miri.

Miri's every move is unpredictable, and Kazuki and Rei find raising an energetic child harder than any of their missions. Although it presents a great risk to their careers, Kazuki and Rei—both assuming the affectionate nickname ""papa""—decide to provide Miri with a normal childhood despite all the odds stacked against them.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundBuddy Daddies was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from March 22, 2023, to August 23, 2023.

                                      (3/13 eps)
                                   
                A show that feels like it's trying to ride on the tailwind of Spy x Family and The Yakuza’s Guide to Babysitting, but captures neither the enjoyability of either show.

To sum things up, Miri is just plain annoying without redeeming qualities, and the two dad are just plain incompetent.

Spy x Family is great, because while Anya can be incompetent at times (which is actually presented in a humorous way), she actually also does help out and does understand her place within the mission; by providing opportunities. In this sense she is even more of a spy than Loid, because not even he knows of her
                  ...
efforts. 
When it comes to Loid and Yor, they accomplish their missions through competency, which is consistently reinforced through everything they do, from disguises to playing tennis.

In Yakuza's guide, Yaeka displays a mature, yet still childish personality. When she pouts, she does it in a cute and mature way, that makes her even more lovable. 
Meanwhile, Tooru is shown as being highly violent and strong. So him, suddenly having to look after a child, his own boss's no less, lets the viewer see Tooru develop a different side of him. And at no point is Tooru suddenly shown as being incompetent.

However, in Buddy Daddies, they do the opposite of what makes the other two shows great. 
Kazuki is dumb and dumber combined. He is initially shown as an intelligent hitman who can plan for a contract and has the ability to disguise himself. Yet, all this intelligence is thrown out the window when he seemingly can't even plan childcare, and is oddly attached to a child he has no real connections to. 
Rei is pretty much how Kazuki should be, but of course if they were both roughly the same, there wouldn't be a story since Miri wouldn't have been looked after. And then there's Miri, which is the main source of the show's problem.
Miri may exhibit qualities of a real child, but realistic does not mean enjoyable. Her place in the show is basically a bad luck totem that brings down literally everyone around her. Kazuki and Rei's hitman skills are negated and the enemies are made even more incompetent.
To use a game analogy, it's like watching a gold ranked player playing against a bronze ranked player. You can see all of the mistakes that the gold ranked player is making, but they defeat the bronzed ranked player simply because they are even worse. And that's basically how the missions play out. Kazuki and Rei will live simply because of plot armor. Which gives the viewer no reason to watch nor care, because you know that no matter how incompetent they may become, the enemy will always be more incompetent. If they were to accidentally drop a grenade in front themselves, I'm sure one of the thugs would somehow end up grabbing the grenade and running off with it before it explodes, thus saving the two protagonists.
In fact, the attitude of Miri isn't the main issue, but Kazuki. Because it's like watching a kid running and screaming in a mall. While the kid may be annoying, equal or greater blame is going to be placed on the parent for not properly disciplining their kid.

To sum things up, this show is just annoying to watch. And there are plenty of other similar shows that are simply NOT annoying.

                If you are going into this, thinking it's just a clone of Spy x Family, then think again. It's far from it. It's remotely from it. Buddy daddys and Spy x family, only share the ideas of spies, or close enough to one, and that is where the similarities end.For what Buddy Daddies is, it's a fun filled action show, with many great comedic segments through out.

Story and characters: 8
To truly give a full experience of how an anime is, is to check out the first episode. Once you've seen that, you'll see the theme of it's story, and how it handles the contents. Being
                  ...
at a rather fast paced, upbeat, and fun ride all throughout. With many over the top comedic elements, sprinkled throughout to make it all work and tick. Buddy Daddies is never a borefest, it's entertaining from start to finish. While even showcasing, just how hard it is, to suddenly be taking care of a little one. They even cleverly hint at this within it's opening act. Creative, and smart. 

To touch upon the characters more, as the synopsis does it best in describing them. As we follow Kazuki Kurusu, a criminal contractor/coordinator who lives with his best friend, Rei Suwa, a professional assassin who has been raised from childhood to be a contract killer. Kazuki is outgoing and loves gambling and women, while Rei is a man of few words who spends his off time playing video games. One day, the two buddies end up caring for Miri Unasaka, a four year old girl whose father is a mafia boss, after Miri accidentally wanders into a firefight in a hotel while looking for her father. as they're just that.

Rei really does feel and seem like a laid back lazy otaku by day, but by night, he's a trained assassin. While Kazuki seems like it'd be perfect for a family. Which has winded up falling onto his lap in the form of Miri. Who is honestly, one of the most realistic portrayals of kids. She's sweet, playful, and most all. Downright adorable. 

Art and sound: 8
Like I said, it's a very upbeat, and welcoming kind of vibe. While also capturing some of the more darker scenes really well. Really making things stay out with it's quality and shine. Even in lesser paced segments, they all come off really good. Knowing full well, when to take it easy more, but still looking great in both areas. They knew to make this anime not only sound and look good, but really match any kind of scene. Huge props there.

Buddy Daddies may seem like 'oh hey it's Spy x family dad version.' When it's it own thing, and doesn't it's love and attention in it's own way. Give it a goooo.

                                      (3/13 eps)
                                   
                Riding the hype from Spy x Family and The Yakuza’s Guide to Babysitting comes an “original” anime about yet another unconventional parent/s tasked with taking care of a sweet little girl.

Kazuki Kurusu and Rei Suwa are a pair of assassins and roomies introduced as two dads trying their best (well, one of them is trying his best). But before viewers can ship the two, the anime takes every opportunity possible to emphasize that Kazuki is very, very straight.

Honestly, I don’t care what the main characters’ sexualities are. If anything, this not-so-new trope actually works best when the parents aren’t in an official relationship, so the
                  ...
story can focus more on their relationship with the kid. But it’s still cute when the parents can at least flirt with each other and be shipped by just about everyone else, like Loid and Yor Forger.

Not that this anime should be a carbon copy of Spy x Family. If that’s what it was trying to be, it’s a complete fail. While Loid and Yor have special abilities that fit their stories, Kazuki and Rei just have plot armor. Seriously. I’m okay with Rei’s bullets always hitting their mark, since that’s just good gunmanship, but how do the bad guys’ bullets never hit their mark? Especially when they fire like 50 for every bullet Rei fires, and no one makes any real attempt to dodge them.

As for the girl herself, Anya is a lot cuter than Miri. Anya has a much more iconic design, while Miri just looks like a normal kid. Bonus points for the bunny backpack though. And I guess maybe that’s the point. While Anya’s telepathic abilities make her more empathetic than any other kid her age, Miri really is just a normal kid. It’s annoying sometimes, but mostly funny as the two roomies try to be dads. If you give this anime a chance, it’s a fun watch. ^^

EditSynopsisKind-hearted Himuro-kun is unfortunate: when in deep concentration, stressed, or flustered, he involuntarily creates blizzard conditions for himself and anyone in his vicinity. During one such incident on the first day of his new job, Himuro-kun encounters the beautiful Fuyutsuki-san, who helps him break out of his nerve-induced ice. As it turns out, Fuyutsuki-san is his new coworker.

At the office, the cool-headed Fuyutsuki-san offers simple and rational solutions to Himuro-kun's icy dilemmas—everything from helping him garden without freezing his plants to ensuring he does not melt during their tropical work retreat. Every time Fuyutsuki-san does something kind for him, the tempest of emotions he experiences inside embarrassingly manifests on the outside.

As a result of the frequent snowstorms, Himuro-kun's feelings for Fuyutsuki-san are impossible to hide. Even though Fuyutsuki-san is unfamiliar with love, Himuro-kun remains determined to repay her kindness and warm her heart in any way he can.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundKoori Zokusei Danshi to Cool na Douryou Joshi was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from April 28, 2023, to July 27, 2023.

                                      (5/12 eps)
                                   
                This show has an issue that you'll find in anime/manga. Especially in romcoms. The main couple can’t get together too soon, because that would turn away viewers who exclusively watch for the romance, but it fails to offer the viewer anything else to distract them from the lack of romantic progression. This mainly happens because Japanese romantic “comedies” tend to disregard the “comedy” part entirely, or at least so it appears to the average western viewer.

Consider shows like How I Met Your Mother and Friends. Regardless of how you feel about these shows, it’s hard to deny that a lot of their viewership sticks around
                  ...
for more than just seeing couples get together. The fact that the entire show isn’t centered around a romance, but instead seeing the cast interact makes the actual moments of plot significance far more engaging. You see, Koori Zouksei Danshi to Cool na Douryou Joshi also makes it cast interact, but fails to not make every interaction a drag. There’s no life in these characters. The “funny moments” are typical anime gags that don’t land on any of their western audience and as a result the romance itself becomes less interesting. When the dialogue is something the viewers just have to “sit through” to get to the “good bits” you have failed as a writer in my opinion and this show is a perfect example of that. I have a soft spot for the romance genre as a whole, so I sat through the first 4 episodes. However, eventually they started taking screentime away from the main cast and instead giving it to an equally boring set of side characters. This made me drop the show.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                If I had to describe this show in a few short sentences in order to truly sell you on it to you, then all I need to do, is describe how nice it is.

Like, let me put it to simple. This is the short of anime you would watch when you've gotten through something thrilling, or action packed. Where that be an anime, or an event in your life. When you want to sit down, drink a nice warm cup of hot coffee or hot coco. To then sit back and enjoy it's context. While this show isn't the most energetic, though it makes up
                  ...
for that in other areas, but what it does do, is give off that happy feeling, that positive energy vibe. Downright wholesomeness from start to finish. The type of work place that you would dream of.

Story and characters: 8
The highlight, or one of for this show. As stated in my previous post above, if the two mains end up not being interesting, then it throws in more energetic character(s) into the mix, to more than make up for it. As if they knew to blend great personalities together, in order to keep things rolling fresh and a joy to watch. But really, the two mains are a treat themselves. Both have their cute moments, where it be Fuyutsuki's general down to earth good nature of care, or how cute her cat is. Or to Himuro's general mind freakouts over happy things that happen to him. It's sweet, it's wholesome, it's a pleasure to witness.

There is just so much to love about the characters. From their quirks, to their natures. You're bound to like them all, not just one or two, but all the cast members you meet, all because of their wholesome, and fun natures. It's a sweet anime, with sweet characters within it.

The story is set in a normal office, with normal people, going about their new careers, or on going careers, and how workmates interact with one another. Done in a sweet setting of two kuuderes, or close enough to ones, slowly falling for each other as the seconds tick on. It's cute, and you'll be glad to be watching it. As while it might be the most exciting kind of show, but it really doesn't have to be. It more than makes that up and more so, with it's good nature, and wholesomeness. I'd recommenced it based off that alone.

Art and sound: 9
The art and look of it all is downright wonderful. I really love the look of the brightness in it's colour, really giving off that good mood, and vibes. While also being really greatly detailed when it comes to night scenes. A mix of both really blends super well, and it's presented so well. The look of the characters, and how it's animated, really bursts onto the screen and reflects that and more so. So does the OP and the entire sound. Matching scene to scene, a job well done on all fronts.More than enough reason to enjoy this product alone.

Who knew, a title with ice in it, could not be so cold, but end being so warm. A must watch for this season for sure.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                  Spoiler 
                The premise of this show is simple: a male employee who has innate ice powers that activate whenever he feels intense emotions has a crush on his reserved female co-worker. That's it. And that's all it needs to be. If you are a fan of romance anime, this show may be refreshing to watch for a few reasons. 

One, it's an office romance, which is a nice change of pace from the oversaturated high school romance settings in anime. Two, so far it has avoided many ""misunderstanding"" clichés common to this genre that can drag out seeing the main couple get together way longer than
                  ...
we want. Three, the main couple have a complimentary relationship in which Himuro, the male employee, drives the relationship because he's simply enamored by Fuyutsuki (but not in a creepy, obsessive way). Fuyutsuki, on the other hand is reserved and we don't hear her thoughts frequently, but she's generous and reliable, if not a little boring. Both are particularly considerate of each other and are really easy to root for. Four, the supporting cast of characters are entertaining, if not a bit superficial. Finally, the OP is a BOP. 

However, at some level, the plot is boring. At this point, the existence of magic powers is assumed and then it's accepted as normal, which is a weakness of not leaning into the premise as fully as the writers could. However, though I wouldn't argue if someone wanted to give it a 5 or 6 out of 10 for this reason, I'm enjoying it at an 8 or 9 out of 10 level. It is cute, amusing fun.

EditSynopsisJunta Shiraishi is a high school student with one simple goal—to enjoy his youth. However, achieving this goal is not so straightforward since Shiraishi is effectively invisible to his peers; even his teachers routinely fail to notice his presence. In fact, there is a rumor circulating that whoever manages to spot him will receive good luck. 

But there is one person who notices Shiraishi's presence without fail. Seated right next to him, Nagisa Kubo is determined not to let him quietly fade into the background. Unfortunately for him, this means that Shiraishi finds himself in some peculiar situations, all orchestrated by Kubo. Despite this, Kubo's playful antics might just be the catalyst needed to spark the thrilling youth that Shiraishi longs for.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundKubo-san wa Mob wo Yurusanai was released on Blu-ray and DVD in two volumes from April 26, 2023, to June 28, 2023.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                Alongside isekai, romance is one of the most common genres in anime thanks to its huge amount of subgenres: School romance, romcoms, romantic dramas, harem, ecchi romance and the list still goes on.
You can even mix the aforementioned subgenres and themes and if the author has its own unique style and makes an effort to create compelling characters with engaging storylines, which the audience may find relatable or believable, it has the chance to become a memorable love story. But there is one big problem: Romance, not only in anime but in every piece of media is one of the weakest genre because a lot
                  ...
of works are generic, corny, awkward and basically the copies of each other. Unfortunately, Kubo-san Mob wo Yurusanai or as I call it, Takagi-san Young Jump Edition is no exception.

After the unnecessarily long exposition, let’s talk about the anime itself. The main protagonist, Shiraishi Junta is an average higshchooler with a pretty absurd problem; nobody can recognize his presence, the fact that his picture is added on the school photo despite being in the picture says a lot. This is also really weird because in most school life anime or manga which contain the students having lessons, the teacher always reads the list of the students’ names at the start of the class. One day, Nagisa Kubo, the titular main character decides to have a closer relationship with Junta and they start spending quality time with each other. You may ask why Kubo-san is a seinen. Its source material is serialized in Young Jump, which is seinen demographic, so Kubo-san is a seinen anime.

Junta is the typical introvert romcom MC, who doesn’t really have much personality, he’s complitely unremarkable, maybe that’s the reason why he’s so invisible to his classmates but who knows. He’s so boring that I have to look up his name from the characters’ list because I didn’t remember it at all. Kubo-san is not much better either. First of all, she doesn’t only wants to help Junta, she seems to be in love with him and the anime hasn’t explained it so far why the latest disposable waifu is so affectionate towards bland MC Nr.42069. Kubo-san’s presence makes this anime another generic male fantasy, where the loser main protagonist doesn’t have any friends, the main girl likes him for no reason, who is also flawless, which is a very concerning sign of bad writing, when it comes to romantic fiction. They also have no chemistry despite having several wholesome moments, which may be engaging but this show wouldn’t feel different if the main couple were replaced.

As I already mentioned, the anime is another iteration of Takagi-san but is also very similar to Nagatoro-san, which is a sadistic and more straightforward romcom version of Takagi-san. This paragraph is about why Kubo-san is the worst anime from these 3 shows. Takagi-san is the story of two middle schoolers, where the main girl teases Nishikata who sits next to her, at first we don’t why she does that, later the anime shows this is how Takagi-san shows her love towards Nishikata. Takagi-san’s humor is pretty repetetive and unfunny most of the time but the two protagonists’ relationship is realistic and wholesome in a natural way. Nagatoro-san on the other hand is about a bully who is actually not a bully tries to help his senpai who is also an introvert but doesn’t really want to socialize at all, that’s why she interacts with him in such a radical fashion. They’re not flawless, the senpai is anti-social, the girl sometimes goes too far and she’s more often jealous due to her other friends. When it comes to romantic chemistry, Nagatoro-san is the best from these three. These things cannot be said about Kubo-san.

The art is decent, the character designs are okay but the background art is pretty nice both terms of colors and details. I haven’t seen so many Pine Jam shows so far but they are one of the studios which may not have too much budget to make anime but still manage to have good production values with their style and Kubo-san has a very soothing atmosphere despite not being a great show.

Kubo-san wa Mob wo Yurusanai is another generic romcom which has its moments but it fails to be entertaining due to its bland characters and overused formula. If you want to see a good anime about an introvert who struggles with socializing because of her childhood trauma and is also made by Pine Jam, check out one of the hidden gems of 2021, Kageki Shoujo!!, you won’t be dissappointed.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                Actually pretty wholesome, but it has its problems

The Story: simple, effective, and works for the environment/message that this anime wants to convey.

The Characters:

Junta, and Nagisa: Nagisa in particular wants to help him be more “visible” to the outside world, and also sometimes teases him, which sometimes can get a little bit comedic. Junta is pretty much the normal, adolescent character, who wants to live in good youth.

the voice acting of the two is pretty good for the most part, and they have a pretty nice bond with each other, even if they get angry, sad, or emotional.

Akina: just a funny, comedic person that keeps on
                  ...
teasing her younger sister (Nagisa).

The Animation:

Pretty good, the movements, the “Chibi/Manga” scenes are well-executed, and overall, is nice and fluid.
The Chibi/Manga-like scenes in particular is WHY this show has a unique essence to it, they sound great as an idea, and even better when used in the final product, and this anime is a great example of it.

Soundtrack:

Nothing too out of the ordinary, but it at least accompanies a lot of the scenes in this anime.
OP and ED sound extremely nice, and soothing

Problems:

“Shiraishi-kun” is an integral word in this entire anime, if you go see this anime, this is one reminder, i’ve heard “Shiraishi-kun” SO MANY FREAKING TIMES that it gets grating after a while, it happens almost every time Nagisa is on screen with Junta, in any situation, casual or serious, i HATED this a lot, and this issue isn’t fixed in the later episodes. 

Akina, and Junta can be unlikeable at moments, Junta in particular, when he’s alone, he’s a VERY boring character, lacking some form of identity in particular. Fortunately, this is backed up when Nagisa finds him. 

Overall, this is a pretty good anime, “Shiraishi-kun” aside, this is excellent in its ideas, and execution.

                                      (4/11 eps)
                                   
                ** spoiler free, brief summary **

1. Story is great in my opinion, but that doesn't matter because storytelling does not suit very well with it. There's like three story lines in 20 min episodes and in the end none of them has satisfying progress, which makes it boring quite a bit. I dont think forcing two or three complex story lines in one episode is a good idea.

2. Art is nice as always, although I think they could do better job with CGI and some monsters. In the end, most of it is pretty enough.

3. from music I'm getting some strong Star Wars vibes and
                  ...
that wouldn't be so bad, if it would be used for epic or big moments only. There are some scenes where I think something lighter should be used, because from their music judgment, there is not so much of a difference between important moments and smaller. Overall I would rate music as good, but I wish they would use it better 

4. characters are quite complex and I get why they need so much spot in episodes. 
But are they interesting? - I would say yes, side characters are interesting, not in the spotlight tho and main character not so much, but he has colorful peronality which makes him interesting in the spotlight. It's perfect dynamic, so it's kinda pity that their storylines are separate and that makes them unable to compliment each other 

Overall I think there are moments worth to watch, but it's not filled with progress, so naturally there are moments not so much worth to watch also. I don't think I can recommend it, but it's not bad enough to discourage you from watch it. I may change opinion and probably will when all episodes come out.

                Danmachi season 4 picked of right where we left last season. In an attempt to reduce destruction inside the lvl 25-27 dungeon, the dungeon itself unleashes a calamity to kill every single adventurer in that level.
The series is just as it always has been, mediocre at best. If you enjoyed previous seasons, come watch this one, but if you are not enjoying previous seasons, don't bother to watch this one.
This review is based solely on the anime. No outside source like LN considered.

Art and Music: 7
Art and music is on the same level as season 4 part 1. The art is very consistent. Nothing remarkable
                  ...
but is nice to see. Animation is also on the same level. Into episode 3, not many battles fought yet (if any), but so far it is not boring. The music while doesn't feel out of place, it definitely can get better.

Story and Character: 5
Overall, the plot is very straight forward. Picking where we left of, and into episode 3 nothing much changed. Not many throw back or background story and ""side quest"" explored yet.
Story telling from every character's perspective is also still done great. Everything is in balance. From bell's party, the hestia family, as well as the viewpoint from people outside the dungeon.
However, the way they portray their character is also as bad as previous season. Bell, while is the main character -many dubbed deus ex machina of the series- and is portrayed very strong being able to slay the fastest monster of the middle level dungeon with ease. Once again having trouble dealing with the problem this time. The direst one so far. On previous season, as Bell can instantly overcome a challenge within one episode, the series failed to make audience feel any character development. To feel any danger to the beloved main characters at all.
This as a cycle happened every episode. Where one character faced a certain challenge and being able to overcome it right on site. This makes the story of each episode felt too similar thus boring.
The story is stuck between wanting to have a strong masculine main character or a weak lovable more feminine main character. One must pick one or the other and can't have both. Or one'll end up with half-assed character in the likes of Bell Cranel.
On top of it all, I can say maybe each episode is only worth 65% content. Despite choosing to instantly resolve any ""minor"" challenge within a single episode, the director dare to include a previous episode summary. And a lot of self-speech. If they have the spare duration to include a summary, it would be a lot better to actually make the character development more believable.
There are even a lot of examples where directors filled the opening and ending song with actual content to make the series more intriguing. To build deeper connection with the audience.

                                      (3/11 eps)
                                  Spoiler 
                The story is okay, it is basically the same theme the last season could have delivered in 2 episodes all over, stretched to probably another few seasons. If they continue this pace, season 6 will not even cover one fight.
On the other hand, the writer did a pretty good job depicting Bell and Ryuus despair being on the verge of death and still having to struggle with monsters coming at them constantly.
The quality, holy cow. I cannot understand how the quality of the show could have gotten this bad compared to the first season. Most of the time we are looking at still shots with
                  ...
little linear movement added, really bad CGI or just characters talking for half an episode WHILE A HUGE DAMN MONSTER IS RAMPAGING 10m AWAY! This is really frustrating and I cannot understand how people hype this so much despite obvious flaws.
I know this all sounds pretty negative, but I am comparing it to the initial state of the anime, which got me hooked. As it is, it is still a better anime than many others out there. I like the characters and the story (whenever there is some progress).

EditSynopsisDuring a blizzard, Masayuki Muroi's old high school friend pushes him off a mountain to certain death. However, Masayuki survives the fall and escapes to safety thanks to Yuki-Onna, the spirit of a beautiful young woman who is said to lead men to their demise—but all she asks in return is money.

Eleven years later, Masayuki has lived a successful life, having gotten married and amassing a great fortune. But when his company collapses and his wife cheats on him, Masayuki retreats to the city where Yuki-Onna once saved him, and he reconnects with her by offering her money and tasty meals. While Masayuki recovers from his misfortunes, another one knocks on his door: his ex-wife is found beaten to death, and now only Yuki-Onna—who cannot reveal herself—can corroborate his alibi.

With no one to turn to, Yuki-Onna enlists the help of the spirits' God of Wisdom, Kotoko Iwanaga. Revered by the various spirits that wander the earth, Kotoko uses her extraordinary wits and cunning to solve all quarrels they may have. In her duty to protect spirits and humans from colliding, Kotoko drags along her immortal boyfriend, Kurou Sakuragawa, and promises to prove Masayuki's innocence without exposing Yuki-Onna's existence.

                                      (4/12 eps)
                                   
                (It's a step up at least)
Well... after a somewhat short wait for season 2, here I am once again watching a series that I will most likely completely forget everything about within 2 months of watching.

Is Kyokou Suiri bad? No, by no means is this a bad series. However, there isn't... anything special about it. The story had potential but is executed poorly, the voice acting is okay, and the characters are semi-decent. One of the few things I do like is the animation. Although considering I tend to only watch stuff from the early 2000s, I guess that's to be expected.

I will say however,
                  ...
S2 is definitely a step in the right direction and definitely held my attention for most of the episodes. S1 was a ""too much speaking"" type deal. It moved extremely slowly in my opinion and the last few episodes, with all the build-up they had, felt extremely boring, and the main fight(s) against the big-booba, no-face, lady felt somewhat ""dry."" Although there are still cases of this in S2, there is an increase in quality/attempt to move away from this. This shows concept is quite interesting, however, its execution could have been/could be a little better. It still feels like the show hasn't embraced a certain ""genre"" and is still teetering on the line between five. One minute they're talking about something really dark and the next they're cracking a joke. On top of that, the story feels a little confined still. There are few ""stakes"" and the number of characters is still too few to make the story feel like it has a ""presence"" in the world they live in at the moment. There isn't anything BIG... something that I'm gonna be like ""ok...ok, I like that,"" there isn't anything Special, which causes the series as a whole to be very forgettable.

Now that it's leaning more/fully toward an investigator/detective type of anime, I guess a slower plot and lots of talking is to be expected, and maybe it's on me for expecting anything different.

Considering that the same man who made Blast of Tempest made this, I guess I might have had ""high expectations"" for this series as a whole, however, it still feels to me like another mediocre entry into this season's roster of shows. After coming back to watch S2 to see if it was more ""my taste,"" it wasn't.  Once again this series is by no means bad, it's just really slow for my taste.

EditSynopsisA decade ago, mankind witnessed the deadly potential of weapons caused by the Great War. To avoid another catastrophe, governments worldwide have resorted to espionage to fulfill their agendas.

In the Din Republic, Lily is an enthusiastic young girl who aspires to become a spy and serve her nation. However, she begins to doubt her abilities, as she struggles to perform well academically. Lily's passion is reignited when she is offered provisional graduation by joining the spy team Lamplight, which she eagerly accepts despite the enigmatic nature of the opportunity.

Upon arriving at her destination, Lily is surprised to find six other girls waiting there, all of whom have faced their own academic difficulties as well. A mysterious man named Klaus soon appears and reveals they must complete an ""Impossible Mission"": to infiltrate the Galgad Empire after just one month of training. Although skeptical, the girls eventually agree to work together under Klaus' guidance—as this might be their only chance to prove their worth as spies.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundSpy Kyoushitsu was released on Blu-ray and DVD in two volumes from March 24, 2023, to May 24, 2023.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                Well, this anime is a disappointment...

Seeing the previews made me think that this show was going about proper spy work, teamwork and nice gimmicks. Character designs and animation look decent and the cast seemed to be fun (though are architecture of clichés). 

All of it to be thrown away by the pacing. It is so bad. All the previous mentioned points were not mentioned in the anime at all and the plot was racing at mach speed. The past 3 episodes were like this: 

Episode 1 was introduction of the cast (normal) to solely focusing on 1 character (why?)
Episode 2 was basic training (ok) to
                  ...
sudden mission (tf)
Episode 3 seemed like it was a season finale. (bruh)

Either the producers or the author had a screw loose in their heads

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                CGDCT: A genre that is about watching cute anime girls and picking a favorite. The only thing you have to decide is what color hair to give each generic girl; and figure out what the T is going to be in your show. 
In this case, “Let’s make them spies” 
The only problem is to come up with a justification for why there must be cute girls doing the Thing in question. And in this case apparently, wars became too bloody and so now spies do all the fighting- and this show seems to think spies are the same exact thing as assassins… Somehow I
                  ...
doubt wars are ever going to be fought by a bunch of teenage girls playing rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets stuck carrying the backpack on a mission, but I digress…

This anime puts a group of cute girls, all who are apparently war orphans, into a nice Edwardian house to be trained for a supposedly ‘Impossible Mission’ by Klaus, a longhaired bishounen who claims to be the world’s greatest spy, and who is constantly making abstract paintings with blood red colors…
But what starts out as Cute Girls Doing Spy Things in a classroom quickly turns into a competition between Klaus and Lily; the more outspoken girl, to see which one of them can take the other out. This turns into a lesson where he tasks the girls with making him ‘surrender’, setting up a students-need-to-beat-teacher challenge that some are comparing to Assassination Classroom. Well that was unexpected. It works pretty well to keep you interested, but there are a few problems.
First, we only really get to know two of the characters: Klaus and Lily, while all the rest of the girls are just cardboard cutouts who dress in their own signature style. It relies way too heavily on exposition; having characters talk about what they just tried to do and reveal their sneaky attempts with dialogue rather than showing them actually fighting- which would require much more animation than this has. It also means it has this Scooby Doo tendency to reveal all secrets to the enemy the moment BEFORE he’s defeated, which just made me laugh out loud. 

The show cashes in all its chips on the Impossible Mission pretty quickly, suggesting it will have an arc style of storytelling- which is fine. But it doesn’t justify having so many characters, each who are supposed to have a Unique Talent. It seems we will find out what each girl’s talent is- mostly through exposition in each future mission featuring all the girls working together as a team- which for some reason has been given the name Lamplight. It's a kind of formulaic type of storytelling that will restrict this anime's ability to make a lasting impression- but then again it could pull another surprise move to keep you guessing, hard to tell right now.
Since this is a Preliminary Review and it’s early, I’d say anyone might like it, it just depends on your taste. I find it very enjoyable, in spite of its weaknesses. I am wishing for more characterization and a lot better world-building than it has; but it’s fun and cute and the dialogue is not bad. I will definitely watch it to the end- 6/10 so far.

                                  Spoiler 
                I actually believe this anime is not too bad, the animation is nice, excluding Spy x Family, I feel as though not many spy animes have been released so this is a nice change of pace. The ""main character"" (Lily, or aka Code name Flower Garden) is not very much to my liking, to be honest all the spy girls are just alright, their sensei is cool at least, but mostly because he's strong. 

But something that should be mentioned about this anime is that it feels as though it's already finished? 3 episodes into the anime and they have already completed their main goal,
                  ...
so it will be interesting whatever happens in future episodes. Animes that take forever to get to their goal also can be annoying, so at least that problem isn't here.

EditSynopsisPrincess Anisphia ""Anis"" Wynn Palletia has always dreamed of flying through the sky, even though the people of her kingdom consider it a silly ambition. Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing ""magicology"" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth.

Due to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard. Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée. After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fiancée as a bully.

After crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing. She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to. Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllia's company.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                finally , after all , we got a yuri anime where everyone around the table can unanimously say that it's good , if you look back at the previous titles in the genre we had :
- Citrus (controversial, but it's good you can't convince otherwise)
- Bloom into you (penguin ending)
- Adachi to Shimamura (boring and slow)
- yuru yuri (kinda subtext)
- Happy Sugar Life (being Happy Sugar Life , you're either into that stuff or a complete degenerate , and I might be the latter)
- Sakura Trick (they kiss a lot ig)
- Akuma no riddle (barely enough yuri to get the tag due to the action
                  ...
taking over it)
- Yurikuma arashi (that's some nice weed you got , unfortunately that much weed isn't very mainstream)
all in all the yuri scene as been quite messy for quite some time , and this anime is just a pure bowl of fresh air
the characters are fun , the vibe is great , the pace is really good too , the art is clean ,the VAs are pretty good , the story is intresting, the comedy is the strong point of this series , and most importantly the chemistry between the 2 main characters is >gold<
2023 has been promising, *looks at upcoming titles* , so does this anime , it did not take me 3 episode to already like it 
so far everything has been a bliss and I can't wait for more.
10/10

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                Animes are built upon layers. A good story, a good opening act, and most importantly, a good set of characters. One thing for sure, having your MC be a great MC. If you're looking for a series that does that, then look no further. As if you're looking for one of the best girls of the entire season, then look no further than Wynn.

Story and characters: 8
The story will take a moment to settle, but once you're settled, you're strapped and ready to dig deep into it. Why? Because of Wynn. Wynn will single handily make you love this show, no matter how you find
                  ...
it. Because she's a great MC, she's energetic, airhead like in her clumsiness. She breaths life into the show, and makes you not only love and appreciate her, but other characters too.It's as if she's the life blood, and it really ups the other characters to boot. Not that they're bad, more that because of having Wynn on screen with them, they become even better. You'll learn to like them, see Euphyllia's struggle, and really sympathize with her. It's a couple you'd want to ship and support for that matter.

As for the story context in itself, it's rather sweet. While it has a serious tone to it, as to be expected, with a show containing royal families and royal connections. But when you see Wynn, you wouldn't even see those titles. You'll see a wonderful happy girl, that will keep you entertained and watching through out.The story follows setting the scene at first, before twisted it into a break up, with our dumbass in Wynn coming in for the rescue. Having the brilliant idea that 'hey, if her brother isn't gonna marry her, then I'm gonna!' Adorable stuff.

Art and sound: 8
I really do adore how things flow and such. As if each scene has good details about them, with the sounds really fitting the atmosphere of it's heaviness, before going to a more gentle tone due to whats going on. Matched with a great art style, that isn't ruined by poor animated monsters that you'd find in other animes that use it so cheaply. It really captures landscapes, and places, where it be at night, ore in the day, really well. Both departments deserves props for this. Hell, just take a look at how the magic looks. Brilliant stuff.

Wynn is love. Wynn is life. But seriously, it's a good show, carried by one of the best MCs of the entire Winter season. Give it a go now.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                This anime resulted in a turn of unexpected events. There are like 10 “fantasy” anime this season and this is one is worth a shot. 

- The starting point of this adaptation was really well executed. The protagonist is someone reincarnated, but that fact is used as a way of making know the audience that she is after all someone to whom we can see ourselves reflected, so we can expect a rational decision from her part, and also interesting ones. 
- Also the series doesn’t start by revolving around the fact that the protagonist is someone reincarnated, puts that fact aside and instead it
                  ...
focuses primarily on the conflicts within each character presented. 

For example:

- The coprotagonist, always putting her responsibilities first, leads her to have a rather despicable attitude so to speak, even telling the prince what he should do and with whom he should be relating, hoping not to disappoint her family's name or the expectations people have of her because of her status, but that kind of attitude is what you would expect from someone being so high in the social pyramid. 

- The prince, brother of the protagonist seems to be like someone who would go against the protagonist for no reason, but later instead he is presented as someone who refuses to follow the established rules of the kingdom, the best part of that is that his reasons are completely justified, as he himself said, what led him to that attitude was having seen all the abuse that someone with a low social status suffers the day to day, besides being fed up with everything that entails being a prince, being restricted of taking his own decisions, also he is going through his rebel phase. The problem is that the anger he feels leads him to make hasty decisions, etc.

Generally speaking, yeah, the characters are pretty good so far. 

- The dialogue. It was really good also, it never felt that any line was annoying and unnecessary for the development of the story, but instead they contributed a lot to it, developing the characters, contributing to the world building, etc. It feels realistic and that’s the most important part. 
An example of a great exchange was the afternoon snack scene between the prince and his fiancée in the first episode, such a solid exchange between characters, simple and quick. In the course of the episodes that solidness didn’t go down. 

- The music (OST): It’s what you expect of a fantasy anime, compared to most OSTs, it stands out, along with the sound desing. the experience is very noticeable. 

- The animation: It was really good, it didn’t disappoint and didn’t got worse later. The animation studio is not characterized too much by the animation of its projects, but in its years of experience which are really shown. The ways they use their resources are extraordinary. 

The production was also carried out by several people with good track records in some cases, working on projects such as ""Owarimonogatari"".

- Right now there isn’t much to complain about and 100% recommend this anime, really hoping to see where this story leads us.

EditSynopsisVeteran adventurer Nick, mage Tiana, cleric Zem, and half-dragon Curran each show up alone at a tavern, only to find themselves seated at the same table. As the night goes on, they take turns divulging their grievances and the hobbies they have taken up as a means of coping. While their stories are utterly different, there is one common thread: betrayal. Each of the four, having been bitterly betrayed by someone they treasured, has developed a deep-seated distrust of humanity.

But in addition to their similar worldviews, the four have one more commonality: a critical lack of funds. Realizing that things cannot continue as they are, they decide to form a party, rank up, and make as much money as possible to spend on their respective hobbies. What these disillusioned adventurers do not know, however, is that they will one day save the world from unfathomable peril.

                If you take the concept of the wrongged hero, make it 4, make it completely shallow, rush any introduction and skipping any kind of development, then you get this show. It can be summed into

--> Being all over the place, lost and without any clear objectives to aim for
--> Being poorly paced, feeling rushed, with a very unatural plot progression
--> Lacking any kind of proper build up or introduction to the world, the characters and their problems
--> The character's interactions with each other feeling completely forced and without any real chemistry
--> Their personalities being lacklusting and anoying, none of them looking charismatic
--> Almost nothing happening

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                I'm going to be blunt, this is not your typical fantasy of the season.
I do enjoy this show to a certain extent, it seems to have a charm to it. To put it simply, it is fun to watch.

Story: 7 (Good)
There are not many episodes out yet, but with this little, we can only get an idea of the direction the anime will take without reading the Light Novel. 
This is a story about four characters that were betrayed by someone before forming their party, and all of them in need of money, like fate, they end up meeting each other in a way that
                  ...
is heartwarming. And Nick being a genious party leader ends up convincing them to form a party!

Characters / World Building: 9 (Great)
I do think I can fit characters and world building in the same category, let me explain.
While growing up, I ended up playing a lot of RPG games. Creating/gearing characters and exploring is what made that genre my favorite, and I think the fantasy in this anime really makes you feel like their party fits very well! Like, c'mon, dont tell me a smart swordsman, a strong dragonkin, an OP mage and a very calm priest don't seem pretty cool?
We dont know very much about the characters yet, but this in a way is a slice of life as well per se, so we will see their development way up until the end.
Their backgrounds not being the most common ones I've seen, feels... refreshing. The way the characters interact with one another feels more ""human"" than most of the animes I've seen this season and I'm all about it.

Sound: 6 (Fine)
The sound of the anime is ""good"", by it's uses you know what is happening, like sound of the water flowing or the voices of people talking in the background. This is a point people tend to overlook, but it is really important to immerse viewers into the world.
The soundtracks of the animes in general make them way more interesting, in which I think in this one doesn't hit the mark quite yet. About the opening... not good, but I've seen much worse.

Animation: 7 (Good)
This is 100% the regular animation you have. Not Ex-arm, not Violet Evergarden. I would say it would be just one and a half points below the original SAO. Or as the MAL scores suggest, ""Good"". It has some sloppy parts, but there are some that are very good as well.

Enjoyment: 8 (Very Good)
This anime surely makes me want to know what happens next to the party and what they will end up doing together. It is not so much about the fighting itself, but more about the party's story. 
People these days are way more critical about animes than when I started watching (back in 2013), and as years pass, people's taste changed a lot(like mine as well), but one thing that stayed always with me is to always try to have fun watching anime. With this I don't think so much about the negatives and reinforce more on the positives. 
And with this comes the question: ""What's wrong with having fun watching anime?"".

Final score: 7.4+1 = 7.5 (8)
I do think this anime has potencial, but as you can see from what I wrote, it's drawbacks are about the sound and animation. With this, I will give it a 0.1 for my future expectations. And like my teachers didn't, I will round the 7.5 to 8.

Mixed FeelingsPreliminary
                
                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                For an anime about disillusioned adventures who were betrayed, it's odd to not find any single one of them to not have an intent for revenge on the ones they thought were close. Are they cynical? Obviously yes. Do they have PTSD due to it? Yes. So you have bootleg versions of Naofumi with different backstories only to realise they are relatively the same character otherwise from their appearances and powers aside.

Story is showing four main characters trying to learn how to move on with their life after subjecting themselves into a life of nothingness as a way to sooth the pain. That's literally it.
                  ...
They just thought that they had to stop wasting away and start being productive without the idea of hitting back on the people who they had complete faith on.

Characters? It's just two personalities. One is as talked about, the main cast is filled with cynicism and nihilism, just has different powers to differentiate from one another. The latter is making everyone a total asswipe, backstabbing the main character as horrible as possible just for the sake of the story. Other than that, everyone is completely bland and provide little to no value.

As for production value, it's quite bad and generic. If you can stomach the stiff movement and weak animation, it qualifies as a weak, stale and mediocre fantasy show with the same fantasy elements everyone knows. At least it's not an isekai where the bland OP character get bitches and never proceeds to gain anything other than that.

EditSynopsisOn the planet Noman's Land, reporters Meryl Stryfe and Roberto De Niro traverse the desert in search of the infamous outlaw Vash the Stampede. But the man they find near the desolate town of Jeneora Rock is a far cry from the lethal terrorist they expect. In reality, Vash is a passive and carefree drifter; he is a proponent of peace, beloved by the residents of the town. His inaccurate reputation actually stems from the widespread atrocities committed by his twin brother Knives Millions. Still, Vash is dubbed ""The Humanoid Typhoon'' due to the tendency for violent chaos to follow in his wake.

Chaos soon arrives in the form of bounty hunters seeking the high price on Vash's head, and their violent pursuit poses great danger to the town and its precious power plant. Thanks to his gunslinging prowess, Vash is able to resist most of these nefarious forces. Yet he must soon face off against the ultimate evil: the unstoppable destructive power of his malevolent brother.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                *If you watched the original Trigun (1998)*: Please save yourself the suffering and skip this one. I wish I did. Unfortunately, besides the retention of some characters and setting from the original, it is not only a completely different story, but different in terms of genre, presentation, pacing, characterization, the atmosphere... Pretty much everything, to be honest. So much so that I wonder why they bought the IP instead of making their own original show, because their vision is simply incompatible with what Trigun sought to be.

*If you did not watch the original*: I strongly recommend you to watch the original instead, it is a
                  ...
classic for good reason. But, if you never intended to watch the original, you may wonder if Trigun Stampede is still good enough to watch on its own. Sadly, my answer to that question is still negative. I'll briefly explain why.

For starters, although the anime bears so little resemblance to the original, it is written in a way that expects you to be familiar with the characters and the setting. There is little to no explanation about the characters and their motives. Instead, the writers presume you watched the original to the end, are familiar with the revelations that came at the last few episodes, and now ready to digest their fanfiction. Who is Vash? What is happening in the first scene with the spaceship? Why does he have the reputation he has? None of these questions are answered, and neither would the viewer be able to figure them out from the context. 

There is a significant amount of (indirect) information dump in the first few episodes, but not in a way that would give you a coherent picture, and too early to fully appreciate. You feel as if you are watching the second season of an anime, but it isn't a sequel; it is an alternative version. This identity crisis alone would make watching Trigun Stampede as a standalone product pretty grating.

But the real killing blow is the pacing and the focus on mindless action scenes that come one after another without rhyme or reason. To be honest, if I had to classify it, I think it would fit the definition of a Western cartoon or action flick better than a Japanese anime. Without spoiling the events too much, the episodes are like a disconnected string of random encounters, and the moment one is resolved, the other one kicks in without sufficient downtime to digest what has happened. 

For one thing, this forces the characters to completely overhaul their personality and goals every five minutes, with no coherence. For the other, it is downright improbable for these events to follow each other with so little time in-between without prior coordination (which is not the case). Therefore, it feels like the writers completely dropped any pretense of realism so that they can keep the audience ""interested"" with more of their mindless action scenes, as if they are kids with ADHD. Or I guess they didn't want their huge animation budget to go to waste?

Frankly, I believe text prediction AIs like ChatGPT could write a more coherent and enjoyable adaptation if you trained them on the original material. If you just want some action scenes and do not care much about consistent writing, I guess Trigun Stampede is still watchable. If it were a standalone anime and the original did not exist, I would likely give it a 5. The context being what it is, it gets a 3. I pity the artists whose hard work and dedication were ruined by the director and the script writers.

                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                Three episodes into Trigun Stampede and I can't wait to see the rest. Having never watched the original I didn't know what to expect. But Trigun Stampede easily delivers a mysterious story filled with zany characters and stellar CG animation. 

   Fights are fluid and fast paced, and the more story driven segments never linger for too long but not quite long enough either. World building could use some expanding apon, but this far into the show it hasn't been an issue. The score works great with the scenes, but nothing has caught my attention quite yet except for the heartfelt opening. 

...
  While there are plenty of episodes left to go, Trigun Stampede is already ranking high in my favorites of this season.

Mixed FeelingsPreliminary
                
                                      (3/12 eps)
                                   
                If you've watched the original Trigun series, this reboot might be a bit disappointing. 

First thing you'll notice is the CG animation. While there are parts this sticks out like a sore thumb (or arm), the fight and action scenes are pretty impressively gone. But yeah, the vibe CG gives out is just not something that currently be hidden. It's especially jarring when characters are trying to be goofy-expressive with facial expression or they're having a gag scene.

Speaking of gag scenes, 3 episodes in and the series is still not at all funny. It vibe is really too try hard and takes itself far more
                  ...
seriously than the first, yet the comic relief and ""clumsy, lucky Vash"" act just doesn't flow well either. It's really awkward, stale, and flat. The original series was yes, was clearly targeting a younger crowd (pre-teens and teens), but it was pretty hilarious as it knew it's identity and what it was trying to accomplish. And the reason why it became such a classic is because it gradually opened up with the story, the events all tied together, and things got real. From goofy and comedic to serious and dark, it was super well done, with great action all throughout. This current series just seems confused on what it wants to be and that's my real issue with this reboot.

Third is, of course they changed up a quite a few things. The hair, the gun, the sunglasses... but really, the worst offender is getting rid of Milly (afaik). This isn't a spoiler, as this is the first thing that fans have noticed when it was announced and it's clear from the first episode. In the original series, the dynamic between Meryl and Millie was so perfect, both progressing the plot and dialogue, and giving the series appropriate comic relief when needed. Most of all, it was fairly ahead of it's time, an older female senpai and a newbie working together on something big (and they weren't reporters then, so not as stereotypical). Speaking of stereotypical, that's what we get now... the old and jaded old veteran and the naïve newbie. Like, come on!

I don't know, maybe this series will surprise me as it goes on. Maybe it just has a rough start and will seriously pick up and surprise us all! I'm still a Trigun fan and I need to resist the urge to be harsh and really approach this reboot with an open mind.

Trigun surprised me once, maybe it can do it again with Stampede

EditSynopsisDespite standing at the zenith as the strongest exorcist, Haruyoshi Kuga sought even greater power, which led to his demise at the hands of those who envied his might. As he draws his last breath, he casts a spell that allows him to reincarnate and swears to become more cunning, hoping that all his efforts will prove useful in his next life.

Haruyoshi is soon reborn in another world as Seika Lamprogue, an illegitimate son of a noble family that prides itself on magic. However, his new family largely ignores him due to his lineage and magic deficiency. Nevertheless, the unbothered Seika leverages the knowledge from his previous life to make numerous valuable allies. As he begins to explore the true limits of his abilities, Seika must also be wary of the consequences that tarnished his past and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

                                      (4/13 eps)
                                   
                simple tldr:
the mc was a strong diviner, shaman, exorcist etc. basically really strong mage guy..
he got killed because of his strength which feared people and got betrayed from his companions,
and so he got isekaid into a rich family without magic, but he still can use his powers from his previous life..
his father enrolls him into a mage school after showing him his powers alongside a companion maid which has some sort of fairy powers..
now he makes his moves really carefully, and looks for the hero in this new world which he is, so the new Hero has companions and won't be alone like himself..

Q: why
                  ...
did I drop it?
A: generic isekai strong guy with some sort of uniqueness, 
""tries not to become the best but oh well, he still is and probably better than the hero because he's the MC and no one can stop him""

Art: 3 (man, the circle which was drawn on the ground near the school is horrendous and we got some CGI)
Sound: 5 (pretty average, VA's good and general ok I guess)
Story: 4 (strong guy, isekaid, again strong, not hero but hero's friend, likely stronger than the hero.. that's it)

                                      (3/13 eps)
                                  Spoiler 
                Have you seen a trash Isekai? Well welcome to another season as this time it isn’t about a doctor getting overpowered or any other anime as such, but an overpowered guy that dies and uses his power to reincarnate into another world. And as expected he’s overpowered and is the casual Isekai protagonist.

The story is predictable. Especially if the protagonist gets in a fight. He will always win because he’s the nice and caring protagonist that’s overpowered. Totally haven't seen that in other anime.

Not to mention, the anime is bland. Although the fights are spicy, the backgrounds are really bland. Other than that, the art
                  ...
style’s average.

The voice actors are good. The voice actors fit each character’s personality, just like any other standard anime. Same for the sound effects. It’s standard.

The characters are generic. The protagonist is the nice and good guy who saves everyone, and Efa, an average nice and loving maid.

The Strongest Exorcist in Another World is absolutely dreadful. I would sleep in the middle of the episode, as it’s just predictable. The story or characters aren't good either. 

If you’d like to waste your time on another trash Isekai with a predictable story, bland animation, and generic characters, then Strongest Exorcist in Another World is waiting for you. Other than that, I highly recommend that you don't watch Strongest Exorcist in Another World. 
2/10

                                      (3/13 eps)
                                  Spoiler 
                It's just another dumb power fantasy isekai, with a stupid plot and unrealistic characters. You should know what you are getting into after reading the summary. There's nothing interesting or original here, but watching it can give that feeling of so-called ""dumb fun"". I definitely don't recommend it though. The biggest problem of this show is its premise, a super-powerful guy who wants to live the life of an ordinary mob. He literally said, ""I want to be one of them. One of the countless masses of weak people."" so what does he do to achieve that? Nothing besides showing everyone he meets how strong
                  ...
and unbeatable he is. Like wtf? What's the point? Well, there's none. Because it isn't supposed to be a well-written thing, but rather just another advertisement for the light novel (which by the level of this production, I doubt is any better). So yeah, don't even bother watching this trash. There are better ways to waste your time.

Synopsis
                      Upon moving into the Separate Palace, Lainie quickly reconciles with Euphyllia regarding her part in the engagement cancellation. Bringing in Tilty to examine Laine, she and Anisphia quickly realize the origin of her charm ability: she is a vampire; a race born from a mad magician's attempts to become immortal. While they manage to teach her to control her ability, this also causes her blood cravings to manifest, which Illia helps alleviate by letting her suck hers. Meanwhile, Euphyllia becomes envious of Tilty upon seeing how well she and Anisphia work together. In response, Tilty tells her that, with her reputation having been restored following the dragon fight, she must make up her mind to either fully support Anisphia or not at all. Later, Anisphia is requested to do a lecture on her inventions. However, the audience, composed of nobles opposed to her research, constantly ridicules her. Fortunately, Euphilia then takes over as spokesperson and convinces everyone of the advantages that the princess' gadgets could bring before revealing a design for a mass-produced version of her flying broom, leaving Anisphia feeling grateful to her for standing up for her.

Synopsis
                      Anisphia visits her research partner, Tilty, to discuss her plans for the materials she got from the dragon. To stop the creature's ""curse"" from encroaching on her, Anisphia has Tilty tattoo the materials onto her back, allowing her to use its magic whilst retraining her humanity. At the same time, she is called in by her mother, Sylphine, to aid in the investigation into the engagement cancellation incident. Questioning one of Algard's friends who sided with him, Anisphia discovers that he does not remember anything from the incident. The next day, Lainie and her father, baron Drax, are called in for interrogation. While Lainie claims to not have had any romantic interest in Algard and Orfans believes her, Aniphia realizes something is off and takes her to speak in private. Examining her, the princess realizes what is going on: Lainie constantly gives off a charm and makes others infatuated with her. Informing her parents, it is decided that Lainie will move in with Anisphia to learn to control her ability. Elsewhere, Algard converses with the minister of magic, Count Chartreuse, about how they will need to step up their plans now that Lainie has been discovered.

                Since no one is writing reviews here yet, I'd gladly be the first one to do so. No worries, I'd be gentle.

First off, the story. It's nothing special. It's cute, it's funny, and it has a nice pacing. 6/10

Now characters. I think they really did a great job of coming up with original dialogues for them that doesn't contradicts with their canon personalities. Great stuff and clever character interactions. 7/10

Art and Sound both get an 8/10. It's explanatory since it's ufotable. The reason why it ain't 10/10 is because the movements are choppy, looks like 4 frames per second. But the art is gorgeous as
                  ...
usual. As well as there's no off models. The sound is just the usual too.

Lastly, my enjoyment. I enjoyed this one because it is short and hilarious. Like, less than 5 minutes per episode. It's not Gintama level of hilariousness, but it was still pretty good. 7/10

Overall a 7.2/10
Good stuff. And won't certainly waste your time since it's short as hell. And if you're a fan of KnY jokes in general, then you'd enjoy this as well.

                Ah valentines day.. Normally it isnt good but surprisingly ds made this valentine my best one.(The announcement and the extras)
Anyways its all comedy. Apparently zenitsu wants to become popular with girls before valentines and takes random advice from the teachers. It was hilarious to say the least and ngl i enjoyed it. It made my valentines special atleast . Anyways u can finish it in 8 to 10 minutes so it doesnt waste your.time Other then that

Animation:8(It were basically random movements)
Story ranging between 7 to 9
Characters ranging from 8 to 9
enjoyment 10
Its highly recommended for ds Fans however it might no appeal to others considering
                  ...
the comedy part of ds doesnt really appeal to alot of people

Mixed Feelings 
                Ah, Valentine's Day, the worst day to be single.

Demon Slayer just released this 4 episode special to celebrate Valentine's Day, featuring the main cast of characters in a school setting as they're put through different scenarios.

This special is quite basic and is nothing special, it's just more Demon Slayer for those wanting more of the series. There isn't much to say about the production values as Ufotable probably knocked this out in a couple of weeks of production. The artwork is chibi-like and there isn't much movement or fluidity in the animation.

There were some enjoyable parts, but nothing else impressive. You can easily finish this
                  ...
in 10 minutes or so, so you won't lose anything by watching this.

6/10.

                Ok this demon slayer special sure was unexpected but, it was great! there was lots of wholesome and funny moments for everyone to enjoy and overall it doesn't hurt you to give it a watch only 5 mins I think most people would find this entertaining and just a nice piece of plain light hearted comedy

Animation - 6/10 Okay visuals just heavy black outlines on the cast
Characters - 9/10 Could of added a couple more its fine
Plot/Story - 6/10 Decent nothing to extreme 
Music - 6/10 Just nice and pleasant to listen too

Overall, i would recommend you to watch this its only a couple of
                  ...
minutes enjoy :P

Not Recommended 
                Chuukou Ikkan!! Kimetsu Gakuen Monogatari: Kimetsu no Utage Tokubetsu-hen"" is an anime that had some special episodes created for the live event ""Kimetsu no Utage"" back in 2019. Although the art style is nothing extraordinary, it does the job. Now, when it comes to the dub, I'm usually a sub purist, but let me tell you, the only content I'd watch the dub for is this one. It's perfect to just have in the background as you do something productive, no need to actually pay attention to the content. So, if you're looking for something to play on the side while doing chores or working,
                  ...
give this a try, you won't regret it!

EditSynopsisXie Lian and Hua Cheng recount their recent adventures during a quiet night at Puqi Shrine. Amidst the serenity, the Crimson Rain Sought Flower reveals a little more about Xie Lian's true character, and an embarrassing memory reminds him of how much he has changed since his previous ascensions. However, no matter how much time has passed, Xie Lian never fails to believe in the good he sees in the people around him. Though the heavens may ridicule him, his words and actions have earned him the most devout of followers.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundHeaven Official's Blessing (天官赐福, Tian Guan Ci Fu) is a donghua based on a Chinese web novel of the same name, written by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu (墨香铜臭). The show falls into the xianxia genre (a fantasy genre influence by Taoism, Buddhism, and Chinese mythology).

                As a big fan of the novel, the manhua and the donghua, this episode was ‘Heaven’s blessing’ in and on itself. 
It was so satisfying and such perfect ending for this season, and, at the same time, is also a new beginning that leaves you feeling desperate for the second season. 
To finally see the MCs facing and interacting with each other, with the best of the best of the soundtrack, playing in the background, was priceless.
And, to finally see ‘that’ face, in particular, was an unexpected and amazing surprise, i must have played that part in repeat 10 times already.
Looking forward to english sub
                  ...
which apparently is coming out this year

                This special is a direct continuation to the 12 episode Tian Guan Ci Fu series. It is a slower paced episode based on character development and oh boy, does it do this in spades. Watching this was like watching a flower start to bloom, petal by petal, unfurling in slow motion. Conversations fully laden with meaning. Restraint. The slow unveiling of a mystery. And then ... the montage with the revelation that you might or might not miss towards the end, is like the flower blooming in full. I was stunned at the beauty and the realization of what it meant.

I had debated whether I
                  ...
should give this a 10 because it is only one episode. The slow unveil leading to a climax has rarely been done half as well in other series. This might be the best one I can recall in recent anime watching history. The face reveal, I had to make sure and rewind it several times to re-watch it. My emotions were in a roil after (I have not read the novel). It makes sense, my heart was singing at the ""rightness"" of it. If anything can generate this kind of feeling and emotion, it deserves a 10.

                HOB/TGCF was great, but this special is even better!! It was very enjoyable and so much fun to watch. 

Tha story was amazing, it really highlights the romance between -you know who- and Xie Lian. There is no backpeddling, no making them brothers, no hostility. This is unlike other shows from China which can be censored to high heaven. 



None of that happens, they just...flirt. They don't kiss or makeout or have any ecchi but that does not mean they aren't flirting...it truly illustrates the love felt bu the charachters. 



Now, I will avoid spoilers however the story is amazing! It truly displays everything fans
                  ...
could want. This is so satisfying it is crazy!



The sound is just as good as the original, however the visuals are better! They do not use any of the bad cg used in the show itself, so it looks very good throughout! 



Finnaly, the charachters are as they are in the show itself. I WILL say the way they display 'that persons' face is gorgeous! the extra details are so fun and watchers can tell the animators took care when showing the side-by sides.



I reccomend watching this after seeing TGCF!! 10/10!!

EditSynopsisFreshman Kaho Nikaidou is from an influential family, and as such, no one has ever said anything even remotely mean to her, for fear of incurring her household's wrath. Wishing to be around people who will not treat her as special because of her background, she leaves home to live at a dormitory for her new school year. Shortly after arriving, Kaho accidentally wanders into traffic and is saved by a tall, handsome stranger. When she asks for his name, he tells her she is weird and walks away. Having finally met the only person to ever say an unkind word to her, Kaho falls head over heels for her savior.

After meeting her rescuer yet again and discovering that his name is Kanade Takahashi, she confesses her love to him. Kanade says he would like for them to be a couple, but that Kaho may not want to date him after she finds out his secret. To her shock, Kaho discovers the startling truth: Kanade is a fifth grader!

Deciding that she can't date a fifth grader, Kaho intends to break up with him. But as she spends more time with Kanade, she begins to care for him even more and continues dating him. Hatsukoi Monster follows Kaho's first steps into love with Kanade, her immature, yet kind, fifth grade boyfriend.

                Let’s make one thing clear. If you love penis jokes, gross indecent crushes and a siscon then this series is perfect for you. If you don’t; welcome to the world of common sense.

*PLOT PART COVERS LAST EPISODE SPOILERS*

Hatsukoi Monster was a show that I was looking forward to quite a bit. I’m a sucker for cute girls in plotless romance series (Ore Monogatari, Orange, etc). You see I don’t need a smashing ingenious plot to enjoy something. What I //do// need is a plot that doesn’t ridicule me. And well. That’s where this show went wrong.

Plot:
While the first few episodes introduce us to our characters
                  ...
and how they handle each other. (This actually had me rooting for the show and shunning everyone who dared speak negativity of it.) Soon enough some questionable things got introduced.  A girl who steals clothing and lives in the same house as the man she stalks. An elder brother with a siscon so bad that he saves her bathwater to drink from. And a butler who gets nosebleeds from his 10 year old master. To say the least this show went for a shocking approach. By episode 6 it’s safe to say that the plot has little to nothing to do with romance anymore and it’s more about how many shocking jokes we can fit into one ep. Personally I don’t find any of these matters to be joked about. Stalking, paedophilia, incest. Haha I’m having a blast. The great resolve of the romance is also something that I missed I think? We get a daydream. A huge out of character confrontation about everything that didn’t make sense about the show (Why Kanade is so tall. Why he only acts childish when the plot calls for it, etc) and after that promises to be together forever that’s it? Also there’s a dog that feels up an underage boy.

Characters:
Usually I’m a sucker for cute girls. I love moe girls that make me want to protect them. But Kaho is just from another dimension. She’s so dense, yet empty at the same time that after 12 eps I’m not sure what her character is like, minus the fact that she loves Kanade. Kanade himself is this weird crossover between a bishie and a child, which is also all there is to his character. The same goes for most of his friends. They look old, act young. All they do is make penis jokes. There’s a mean dude who doesn’t want Kanade and Kaho to date. There’s a few funky housemates who do have interesting characters yet none of them are ever explored enough to be truly likable. And their relationship to Kanade and Kaho seems to be made of nothing but ‘we live in the same house so we’re friends right?’  

Sound:
I’ll be honest. One of the main reasons that drew me in for this show was the cast.  I’m an avid seiyu fan and seeing so many talented ones in one show was what got me hooked. That was also all I did enjoy about the show.
The opening is generic and the ending had me wonder what it had to do with a romance anime. The OST is decent. It reminded me of grade school.

Art:
The art is. Decent? I’ve seen worse. I’ve seen better. It’s not striking despite its colour palette. It has it’s good and bad moments. Key moments especially are the generic ‘wow I’m so in love with him’ shots and they’re pretty cute. But they easily get balanced out by laughably bad backgrounders

Overall: 
Like I said in the opening you can probably not enjoy this If you like decent plot. I only finished watching it because I was waiting for it to regain the grace it had in the beginning. I can deal with whimsical, weird plots. But the plot has to be there. This show completely gave up around episode 4 and sailed onwards with nothing but penis jokes and drama that had me laughing more at being expected to believe it than actually enjoying it. Add to that the risky/downright gross subjects brought up and I personally can’t believe this series is supposed to be anything but an insult to the people who spend time on it. 

If, on the other hand, you love series that need you to turn your brain off to enjoy it. By all means this is the series for you.

                TL:DR at the end

~Contains spoilers~

Have you ever thought about what it would be like if all the kids you babysit were hot bishie airheads who made penis jokes and periodically break up with you because of reason's shallower than the kiddie pool at your local country club? No? Good, then you're normal.

The author of Hatsukoi Monster clearly is not.
________________________________________
STORY: 1/10

Exactly what you would expect from a shoujo story, the only difference being that the parts you can't stand (ex. melodrama, breakups, jealousy, stupid comedy) are magnified by a tenfold. Other than a couple laughs due to the absolute ridiculousness of making 5th grade boys look
                  ...
like college students, and the author's deluded dream of pedophilia becoming legal, the story has absolutely nothing to offer. It will turn away even the biggest fans of the genre. 
________________________________________
ART: 3/10

See, the thin I hate about shows like these is that they usually get very good art and animation, which could have gone to much more deserving series.. Luckily, Hatsukoi Monster wasn't gifted with good art or animation. It's very colorful, and the palette gives it a childish look, which I think they were going for, so that's good. But everything else is subpar at best.
________________________________________
SOUND: 3/10

Though Hatsukoi Monster wasn't blessed with good art, it was blessed with some AMAZING voice actors. Not all of them, mind you, and some of the characters' voices are annoying, even the ones that aren't intentionally meant to be annoying. That said, some of the voices help to bring the otherwise flat characters to life, and was probably my favorite part of the show overall. Other than that though? The opening and ending theme are hopelessly bad and the sound effects were no standout.
________________________________________
CHARACTER: 2/10

Oh god. This has to be THE most intolerable character cast I've seen in a while. The only characters that didn't make me want to break my screen were Kanade, Mafuyu, and Gin. Before that though, lets talk designs. 

If you had looked up bishie template, colored the hair all the colors of the rainbow with microsoft paint and then told your editor to slap a couple of accessories on each of them, I don't think I would have noticed the difference.

On second thought, that's probably what they did...

Personality-wise, most of them are just recreations from your typical reverse harem/shoujo story, from evil megane to trap boy to sis-complex older brother. And then the rest of them are just fifth graders cracking penis jokes like nobodies business. Though it was funny at first, it just becomes idiotic after the first couple times. And this is coming from a GINTAMA fan! However, I will say that Gin, Kanade, and Mafuyu manage to show a bit of personality, and are at least consistently amusing to view.
________________________________________
OVERALL: 2/10


TL:DR

+Some good voice acting
+ Some likeable characters
-Ridiculous plot
-Filled with tropes amplified to become ever worse
-Bad art
-Not memorable OP/ED, or OST
-Terrible character design
-Most characters are annoying

Hatsukoi Monster is an immature pile of garbage that can only be enjoyed if you are as immature as it's characters and humor. Nothing wrong with that, it's just not for me.

Maybe next time, try falling in love with someone your age.

                After watching the first episode I thought this was going to be a pretty good comedy. I even turned some people onto the first episode because I thought the premise was pretty funny and unique. Then it quickly stopped being funny and became a real romance story between a high school girl and an elementary school kid. 

After watching the first episode you might assume that the story is going to be big joke watching this girl try to find a way out of her relationship without hurting the guy's feelings, and also try to hide her relationship status from other people so they don't
                  ...
get the wrong idea. Then it just becomes a story about how this girl is actually legitimately in love with this child. That story is just annoying and weird, and the background characters can be described in the same way. 

Even the art in this show is really hit or miss in very obvious ways. Sometimes it looks like standard shojo style, sometimes the perspectives are weird, or the eyes are drawn funny, or something else goes off in an easily visible way. 

I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone. Even the first episode, which I thought was decent at the time, is nothing more than a tease for what this series could have been.

EditSynopsisIn the future, a meteor crashes into Earth and brings with it a virulent form of life. This virus is known as M34 and attacks humans, turning them into vicious monsters. Most of the human population is wiped out, thus government agencies are formed to fight the virus. One of the groups, NOA, inserts nanomachines into the bodies of its soldiers; these machines allow them to transform and fight off the infected. Unfortunately, the virus mutates and becomes too strong for NOA to handle. Now the fate of the world rests in the hands of 16-year-old girl with the power to defeat the virus.

                        Zaion is a basically a story about a meteorite which landed on Earth containing an  alien virus that has begun infecting humans.  So basically this is very similar to the Resident Evil theme.  The story must also take place in the future because they have warriors using nano-technology and mecha-type machines to fight against these mutated humans.  They also decided to stick in a bit of romance which is basically a love at first site ordeal.  Overall, the series is worth watching considering it's only 4 episodes and can be watched while
                  ...
you're waiting for your ongoing anime to be posted.  

Unfortunately, I can't help having a sense that I was robbed.  This could have been a really good series if they wanted to make it a 12-13 episode series and started from the beginning.  However, this story takes place after people have been infected and people have already been created to destroy the infected beings.  Seeing as it was only a 4 episode series they could only hint upon different things that could have happened.  Plus, how things came to be are never explained in detail and it seems like the plot was rushed.

 Considering the anime was only 4 episodes I thought they did a pretty good job with character development and the character art suited my taste.  Plus the sound fit in well and I enjoyed it......still I'm bummed it was only 4 episodes.

To all those who enjoy an action anime I suggest you watch it.  And to those who don't, it's only 4 episodes.....you might as well watch it too

Mixed Feelings 
                Zaion is an exercise in lack of thought. Not defective thought like some animes, no half-baked explanations of convienient plot twists, but a nearly complete lack of interest on the part of the writers. The second half begins to redeem the show but it's already too late. Mediocre story, stale characters, and glaring holes in logic have done their damage.

The Setting:
 At some point in the past (at least 1 year ago tho no time frame is given) a meteor fell to earth releasing an alien virus that causes the infected to turn into rampaging mutant monsters, infecting anyone they touch. There is no cure
                  ...
so the only way to deal with an outbreak is to seal the area and kill all the infected. A secret organization called C.U.R.E. is responcible for containing outbreaks and keeping the whole thing secret from the world. Their dedication is aparent by the way no one seems to care how it all turns out. The operators for their remote assult robots act like it's a boring videogame (""Finally I'm dead, now I can get a coffee""), the nanite-infused NOA soldiers are given no equipment and are left to kill hoards of mutants barehanded (sure they have superstrength and armor but give the poor guys a grenade or 2 at least), and not only does no one seem to bother using any kind of tactics but in the end when they start, they get arrested for it (for disobaying orders, yes. but still).

Story: 4
 All of this is meant to be backdrop for the mild romantic story of Yuuji, a NOA soldier, and Ai, C.U.R.E.'s new superweapon (who creates a 40' hologram that hugs things to death. how this is supposed to be the ultimate weapon to combat a virus is anybodies guess). It starts off poor, as no character has any personality until the second half, but gets more interesting toward the end.

Sound: 5
 Nothing good or bad worth mentioning

Art: 4
 Nothing spectacular but nothing too bad either. Except the CG robots. They're as generic as possible to make things easier on the animators and were very poorly meshed into otherwise hand drawn fight scenes. Mostly they don't even move except to walk forward until the big fight in the 3rd episode. They barely move while getting jumped and smacked around by guyver-esque mutants while then fall over at the wrong time in weird directions  like someone's poorly done greenscreen fight.

Character: 3
 One of the worst parts of this show. All the characters and completely lifeless until the second half. After which point most of them die as soon as their personallities finally come out. Even the 2 mains only stand out because they are the focus of the story. If not for that, they wouldn't even be memorable.

Enjoyment: 5
 For the first half I found myself with nothign better to do than pick though all the strange logic that presented itself. But once the story began to come together and the characters started to gain personallity, I found I began to like the show. Zaion does finally manage to leave that pleasent feeling from the happy ending (though the ending itself presents another hole in logic if you're already thinking about such things)

Overall: 5
 Not very good, but some will like it anyway. And it's short enough to watch in one sitting.

Mixed Feelings 
                I will begin by saying that, while the review may sound scathing, this mini-series has some things going for it. If you enjoy the super-suite type mecha stuff in the vein of Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040, it's graciously short, and ultimately may be worth watching for you.

The plot isn't really the issue. It's another take on something we've seen time and time again, and for that get's a mediocre score. It didn't try to reach anything new, didn't overstep its boundaries, and didn't use any lame explanations to try to change the game from similar stories that preceded it. 

The main issue I had is
                  ...
the cheap, quick animation and art style that so many 90's/early 2000's anime series suffer from. This show feels pumped out, robotic, and just like there wasn't much effort put into it.

The characters are all takes on popular anime cliches too. The helpless girl, imprisoned and weaponized; the ace pilot who's angry at the corporation that forces him to fight, etc. 

Surprisingly enough for as lazily as the show was done, whoever put the soundtrack together did a surprisingly great job. Even in parts where poor character exchanges would've normally had me saying ""Oh god, get on with it."" The soundtrack managed to make me second guess my nonchalance and almost want to feel what they are failing to bring across emotionally through rushed dialogue.

Not bad. Just not original. If you're in desperate need of some kids in cyber-suites killing inhuman monsters, then check this one out. If you're looking for something new, great, or visually stirring, pass right by this one.

EditSynopsisThe heavens shake, the thunder rumbles, and Xie Lian appears with an apologetic smile—again! Eight hundred years prior, he was a beloved martial god, known as the Crown Prince of Xianle. Now, he ascends to the heavenly realm for the third time, but simply as a pitiful scrap-collecting god with no followers behind him. 

On his first mission, Xie Lian finds himself alone in the dark moonlit night. There, a gentle man dressed in red guides him through the forest. However, as abruptly as he appeared, the man suddenly dissipates into a swarm of silver butterflies.

Xie Lian later learns that this mysterious stranger was none other than Hua Cheng, the Crimson Rain Sought Flower, a Ghost King feared by both demons and gods alike. But before Xie Lian can figure out why Hua Cheng would help a Heavenly Official like himself, he meets San Lang. A young man possessing great knowledge on not only the Ghost King, but also the now forgotten Crown Prince, San Lang decides to accompany Xie Lian on his journey of unveiling the mysteries of the past.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundAdaptation based on a Chinese web novel of the same name, written by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu (墨香铜臭). The show falls into the xianxia genre (a fantasy genre influence by Taoism, Buddhism, and Chinese mythology).

Mixed Feelings 
                Thanks to Mo Xiang Tong Xiu (MXTX) and very devoted BL fans, the MDZS review I wrote is the most upvoted review I have ever written. How could I miss the opportunity for clout by dropping another bomb review? (You can interpret ‘bomb’ as amazing or terrible)

However you look at it, MXTX have done pretty exceptional, even with the ongoing court scandals. She hasn’t written many novels but all three of her existing novels have been massive hits. Gaining a huge Chinese and foreign following. As we know, MDZS’s popularity is already off the roof and now comes the TGCF anime. And no, I’m not
                  ...
going to write a review about Scumbag System, in fact, let’s pretend the anime didn’t exist, I want clout but not that desperate.

Okay, I’ve hit my intro quota, let’s get dive right into the pit! No need to pull me back up Ruoye.

I gave the anime a very warm 6 instead of a neutral score of 5 because I think it is actually an alright anime and go easy on it, not too critical for once, rare occasion. If you clicked in from seeing this ranked 22 (dropped to 67 as I revisited it now, 2 above Fate Zero s2) on the top anime category, you might be thinking what’s this? Why? I will reveal to you right now, read the first line of the review. China continuously brings us content that they censor, crazy, I know.

Story:

Not to be that person “THE MANGA WAS BETTER” but TGCF is a one-million-word slow burner type novel, 1,144,742 to be exact. (For reference, The Harry Potter series is 1,084,170). On top, one million Chinese characters is much more than one million of English words due to succinctness of the language.

The anime is alright in terms of adapting, due to censorship, some details and story is either cut or been made tame, however, it doesn’t have a major effect on the main body of the work. Okay, so it follows the novel closely, why does it still feel so damn slow?? As mentioned above, the story is a long slow burner, the 11 episode is 10% of the whole worldview, we are just hovering on top of the iceberg, haven’t even landed on it. There are so many foreshadows in the anime that is glanced over if you never read ahead which is why it’s dry if you don’t see how it’s a twist later on. Like whom the fuck is this San Lang guy why is he so op?? TGCF is another Chinese Xianxia novel, the genre has a lot of lore and terminology which can be difficult to digest for a new watcher. The story itself has lots of lore that isn't explained in the anime, so that’s a double whammy on concept and story. 

Animation:

The section that pains me regarding Chinese anime. Let’s talk about the good part, the animation compared to other Chinese animated series, it’s pretty good. The art for the OP and ED, absolutely beautiful.

However, in the sea of good Japanese animations, it is hard to break through. TGCF is pushing it in terms of fight choreography, some frames are subpar. Not to mention that one fight scene in Ep9 that looks oddly similar to a scene in Attack on Titan. Yike Haoliners, that’s low, plagiarising a top airing anime of the season like nobody will notice…

Some scenes have 3D incorporated which is a bit off since the eyes can clearly recognise it’s not the same. Ep6 was just bonkers, the mouth flaps don’t match, random loop footage, wrong audio mixing, they fixed it now but my god if you saw the first upload you would be like what the heck.

As for character designs, it has the same problem as MDZS and a handful of Chinese animes. Everyone has the same face more or less. There are only two type of design that exist here, bishie main cast and then ugly commoners, this is actually a good way to see the foreshadow, if the character is drawn like a bishie, they are important, eg. the reveal in Ep11 of that Bishie which apparently nobody recognised because everyone look the same. Before anyone have a go at me how this is Danmei (Tanbi in Japanese), which is a pursuit of two beautiful handsome men in a romantic relationship but come on I want to differentiate the characters too. I’m not the only one with this problem because I’ve seen people in the comment go “omg is this xxx what a plot twist”, no sweaty, I know they have a cape on so you can’t tell what clothes they are wearing because that was the only indication.

Sound:

The OP and ED are amazing, all sang by very good Chinese singers. The 2nd ED contains acrostic lyrics, which is a neat detail.

Voice acting is overall not bad, little stiff for some characters but it’s not big problem.

As for music, I’m about to slap the editor. If you watched this on Funimation you won’t have this problem. I watched TGCF on official Bilibili, which has an ad that features a yoghurt at the beginning of the episode after you press play, the ad is animated with Xie Lian saying ad lines with music playing in the back. When there’s an emotional or climatic scene in the anime, they play the same soundtrack, I have been conditioned to associate that specific soundtrack to the yoghurt and it become a reflex reaction and I just go ah full of peach bits, full of love, this yoghurt is the real thing, this takes you out of the scene and you can’t go back. Come on, do you not have budget for this, you took a sponsor, get a new track on that ad please. 

And the very end:

The anime has ups and downs, not a bad watch. Hard on new viewers, you've been warned newbies.

Until next time
天官赐福 (Tian Guan Ci Fu)
百无禁忌 (Bai Wu Jin Ji)

                Chinese animation is on the rise.

With anime enjoying an explosive surge of popularity in China over the past decade, it’s a bit of a surprise as to why higher budget, domestically produced works tailored to an older audience have taken so long to appear. Nevertheless, donghua has finally begun to make its mark on the wider anime community, most notably with The King’s Avatar in 2017 and Mo Dao Zu Shi in 2018. 

Tian Guan Ci Fu is the first donghua that I’ve watched in its entirety - like many others, I was intrigued by its placement in the top airing list, alongside the eager
                  ...
recommendations of novel readers. Unfortunately, thanks to a horrifically executed second arc, almost non-existent character development, and some of the worst editing I’ve ever seen, Tian Guan Ci Fu is a resounding disappointment.

Two major arcs occur throughout the course of this series. The first, taking place over the course of a brisk three episodes, is the better of the two. In order to pay off a massive debt caused by his third ascension to Heaven, our main character Xie Lien travels to the mortal world as a Heavenly Official to solve the mystery of the ghost groom at Mount Yujun, accompanied by the hot-headed Nan Feng and Fu Yao. On most accounts, Tian Guan Ci Fu actually does really well with this first arc. The mystery is well crafted – the suspense is built just right, and with some nice action sequences sprinkled into the mix, it does a good job with drawing in the viewer. 	

Much of this introductory arc’s success hinges on a couple of key points. Hardly any of the world’s mechanics are explained: the ascension/banishment process, magic formations, and what actually goes on in Heaven are some of the many details that are barely elaborated on. Character development takes place - mostly on Xie Lien - but is minimal, although this is pretty forgivable since most of the focus is on the mystery. And the resolution of the mystery itself is lacklustre – the rationale behind the apparition’s actions had more or less been deduced by Xie Lien, but for some reason the writers decided it was necessary to have a convoluted flashback backstory written out, something that added little to the overall experience for the amount of screen time it took (kind of difficult to make a character morally ambiguous after they’ve murdered seventeen innocent brides). Addressing these issues was key if any initial momentum was to be kept.

Tian Guan Ci Fu doesn’t just ignore the issues, but flat out magnifies them to the point where later episodes are legitimately painful to go through. Recurring characters get ZERO development, and I’m not exaggerating when I say this. Apart from basic character traits established by superficial interactions, we really don’t learn anything about the personalities of any of the characters. The biggest offenders of this would be Nan Feng and Fu Yao. Their sole defining traits are that they have temper problems and that they dislike each other. As a result, they’re also the main source of comic relief, but their antics get old very quickly, and the constant yelling does not help. The world building is awful, with constantly shifting, unconnected settings that largely remain unexplored – a real shame, because the world itself is really intriguing. There’s a critical lack of cohesion here, and everything feels more like an arbitrary chain of incidents stringed together than a natural progression of events.

A major reason for all of these problems stems from Tian Guan Ci Fu’s boring and flat-out wasteful dialogue. The second arc is extremely heavy on dialogue, but it’s dialogue of the worst kind: sloppy exposition dumping. So much of the show is spent on a character explaining really minor plot points in intricate detail, usually accompanied by a flashback of some sort. Any time there’s a “twist” or a character feels the need to explain their actions? Flashback. Not only does this feel clunky and unsubtle at times, but it also eats up runtime that would have benefited way more on character or setting development, and it’s also just a mind-numbingly tedious thing to go through. So it’s a double blow of sorts: lazy, boring exposition that has no right to take as much time as it does. The second arc in general is a bizarre change in direction and I’m struggling to understand why this decision was made.

Because there’s so much exposition, not much actually takes place over the course of the second arc, and everything moves at a snail’s pace. The majority of the exposition is delivered by San Lang, a mysterious young man who seemingly knows about everything. Well-written dialogue can convey both information and the personality of whoever’s delivering it in a concise manner, but the laziness of the script means that San Lang joins the list of flavourless characters. Apparently there’s supposed to be some romance going on between San Lang and Xie Lien, but when characters with the personalities of wet flannels flirt with each other for no clearly established reason, it’s hard to get invested. 

Good editing can often save scenes that would otherwise be a slog to get through. But Tian Guan Ci Fu’s editing is just horrible. The editor has this really weird obsession with fade to black transitions when switching between scenes. Due to taking significantly longer than something like a cut, fade transitions have a major slowing effect on pacing. This isn’t the greatest choice, because if an episode spends half of its runtime on information dumping, the last thing you need is something that makes things even more slow paced than they already are. Some conversations and interactions awkward too, with characters regularly reacting in unnatural time intervals.

Then there’s the completely inexplicable errors: in episode 6, there’s a shot involving a botched looped animation of Xie Lien walking that has a frame with his mouth open, which cycles for about ten whole seconds. In the same shot, Xie Lien’s mouth movements stop prematurely, and then San Lang’s mouth starts moving while the audio of Xie Lien talking still plays! Speaking of which, the show has a consistent issue in lip flap and audio sync problems, but this segment is the worst offender by far. I also need to mention how this shot happens to involve one of San Lang’s many exposition dumps, so the fact that the shot lasts over ten seconds in the first place is another big no-no. In episode 10, there’s a shot involving a girl dancing to the beat of Xie Lien’s clapping and a person playing the tambourine… except that Xie Lien's clapping very clearly does not match up with the tambourine player. And in certain episodes, the VAs for Nan Feng and Fu Yao stand way too close to the mic, because whenever they yell (which happens a lot), you can hear this annoying distortion effect on their voices. These are really basic errors and the fact that all of them went unnoticed by the editor is mind-boggling. At times the result can be funny, but more crucially it's distracting to a fault. I honestly don’t remember the last time I got this distracted by bad editing. I raise these examples at the risk of coming off as nitpicky, but these are just the ones I can think of from the top of my head. I don’t mind the occasional mistake, but when it happens consistently like this, it just completely takes you out of it. 

That being said, it’s not like Tian Guan Ci Fu does everything wrong. It has a decent, well-produced soundtrack. The voice actors do a serviceable performance. And, as mentioned earlier, the first arc was great. In fact, earlier episodes in general were fairly enjoyable, benefiting greatly from gorgeous backdrops, fluid animation and well-choreographed fight scenes – qualities that degraded as the episodes progressed but nonetheless remained at a reasonable level. It’s clear that some serious time, money and effort was put into producing this, which makes it all the more confusing why they couldn’t hire a better editor, or director for that matter.

Tian Guan Ci Fu’s novel is widely lauded by readers for its masterful storytelling. This quality does not seem to have translated to its donghua adaptation. It really is quite frustrating because it had all of the tools needed for something special: a possible fate hinted by an encouraging introductory arc. Unfortunately, the show fails to maintain its initial high and spirals lower and lower into the abyss as the episodes go on, before crashing in a heap by the end. Because of how uninteresting I found the second arc to be, I have to say that Tian Guan Ci Fu has overall been an unenjoyable experience. Unless watching beautiful men flirt with each other is your thing, stay clear from this one.

                Outstanding, beginning to end. A pity that the end came so soon!, i seriously hope we get more seasons on this. 

When i started watching this, i did not realise that it was from MXTX, the same author as another of my favourite donhuas MDZS - shame on me!.  

I had not read the novel prior, but i have now, and cannot wait for more of this beautiful animation to come back. And really looking forward to the extra episode in February.

I have not watched near as much Chinese animation as Japanese, but recently, they have nothing to envy the other. This is an
                  ...
example of one such wonders.

The story grabs your interest from episode 1, i’m a sucker for historical and supernatural, and this one also focuses on the lore of the gods and the three realms, with a twist, where not all gods and ghosts are what they seem like.

It starts introducing the characters that certainly have quite the story behind, cannot help but to be captivated by every single one of them, from the main to the supporting, you just want to continue to get to know more about them.

The animation, the voice acting, the expression on their faces, is just great. 
The action scenes, with an exception on one that uses too much cgi, are excellent. 

Pleasing to the eyes and ..the ears!! the soundtrack is something else. I love animes that bring sound into the equation, and this one did it beautifully, i have quickly downloaded the ost for further enjoyment.

Sure, it is meant to be a BL story, and there are some tiny hints of it on these first episodes, so if you dislike it, be warned. The story is absolutely awesome, being BL or ‘brotherhood’ or whatever you wish. 
And having read the novel now, because i could not wait to know what happens next!, this is, without a doubt the best love story i ever read, nothing comes near. The story just keeps getting more interesting, action pack, mystery, is just awesome, definitely recommended.

I have thoroughly enjoyed watching TGCF, every scene, every detail has been crafted so beautifully and brought to life with such care. Is it deserving the rave? absolutely! There is no doubt in my mind as to this is going to be the first to be dubbed in english next year

It may not have been the best year, but thank you 2020 for bringing this jewel to us!

Synopsis
                      The final battle begins as Kasel and his friends separate Angmund from Eia. Unfortunately, Eia was actually restraining Angmund's power and without the holy sword, Angmund can fully unleash his power on the heroes. Kasel barely grabs Eia, just in time for Riheet to give him the pendant created by Illya. The pendant creates an armor that protects Kasel from Angmund's dark power and with the full power of Eia, Kasel frees Kyle from Angmund's armor and allows his soul to depart to the afterlife. With the battle over, demonic activity has decreased significantly. Scarlet offers Riheet a noble title as an attempt to promote peaceful relations between Orvelia and the dark elves, but Riheet requests some time before he can make his decision. He first needs to educate his fellow dark elves about Illya's actions, hoping that, in time, this will improve relations between Orvelia and the dark elves. Before leaving Orvelia, however, he gives the pendant to Kasel.

As Riheet reunites with Ripine, who barely survived Malduk's attack, Kasel and Frey reunite with Cleo and Roi, ready to begin another adventure together.

EditSynopsisLong ago, the king of Orvelia, Kyle, defeated the demon king Angmund and brought peace to the world. However, one hundred years later, demons have been sighted in the forests, threatening humanity once more. A scouting expedition is sent to verify the claim but only one member returns. Meanwhile, Riheet, the leader of a dark elf mercenary group, plots to take over Orvelia to exact revenge against the humans who forsook their race a century ago.

The knight apprentice Kasel, accompanied by the priestess Frey, sets out to rescue Clause, an old friend who went missing in the tragic mission. However, along the way,  Kasel discovers that he is the son of the revered King Kyle and the only one who can wield the Holy Sword Aea—the same sword that slew the demon king. To fulfill this destiny, the young knight must embark on a perilous quest, unseal the sword, and end the fear instilled by demons. As Kasel's journey to bring hope to humanity and Riheet's vow for vengeance intertwine, what fate could possibly await them?

                At this point, I think only a few of us actually got through all 26 episodes of King’s Raid. I for one, don’t regret a single moment of it. 

Yes, King’s Raid is a pretty generic fantasy gacha game adaptation that does absolutely nothing game changing or innovative. Yes, there’s plenty of better shows out there. No, that doesn’t mean I didn’t like it. In fact, I loved King’s Raid. It is a slow burn over the 2-cours span that it runs, but once it gets going, I found it to be very entertaining. For context, when I watch anime, I usually multi-task by farming
                  ...
FGO or other gacha, KR was one of the only shows in the past two seasons that actually held my interest long enough for me to put my phone down and fully lock in.

Despite the generic set up of a chosen heir to the throne going on a quest with his standard JRPG party to defeat a demon lord, I thought Kasel and RIheeto’s juxtaposition as duel protagonists was well done. In fact, by the end of the show I was feeling much more sympathetic towards the secondary protag than the main guy. The dynamic between both of the MCs and their parties was really fun to compare and contrast over the course of the anime. The studio aids with that by alternating perspectives every episode. I also liked the mystery down the stretch with unravelling Kasel and RIheeto’s pasts. It seemed like the studio knew exactly when to end episodes to leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more.

Due to its nature as a gacha game adapdation, as you’d expect the animation is meh at best throughout much of the show. For the vast majority of the 26 episodes it’s pretty average. I’d put it above Hortensia Saga, but well below the likes of Priconne or even the Gran Blue anime. The art is REALLY nice and was actually one of the big reasons I liked this show. It has this really glossy look that makes the characters shine a lot and really makes the waifus in the show pop out.

I probably wouldn’t recommend King’s Raid to most people, not because it isn’t good to me, but because it probably would be boring and uninspiring to others. I think for most people, there’s more enjoyable ways to spend 8 hours. That said, I’ll never apologise for liking what I like and finding something to be entertaining. King’s Raid gets 8 holy swords out of 10.

                Ah...King's Raid, one of the most popular indie mobage games in South Korea, such a good game that's amassed with the huge popularity in its home country. The anime version which features a different story from the game's plot, frankly, I can sum in one word: TRASH.

As with every other game adaptation, it's nothing more than the marketing ploy of tactics to get people to play the original game, and that by every aspect, has succeeded one way or another without going into the specifics of numbers. But the way that King's Raid was planned with the anime adaptation, I have no idea what the
                  ...
production committee was thinking to make it more than twice as long (as any typical 12-episode run), which in return makes it compoundingly twice as boring. And with twice the story plot (the hero and the villain), sadly, when the villain's story is more interesting than the hero...that's just one of many make-or-break moments that this show could've capitalized on, but went in the motive of DRAGGING the journey for ""God knows how long the hero must play King Arthur to find the sword in the (magic realm) stone that slays evil"".

The story...nah, heck it, I'll impose a question instead: Do you prefer to watch the typical cliche Hero and his mercenaries on a long-ass journey to find the Holy Sword, or focus more on the villain side with the Dark Elves and the reasons behind the usual kingdom tyranny that causes them to go berserk to the point of rebellion? I'm pretty sure you know the answer deep in your heart as to which is more compelling if you want to watch this needlessly 6-month long run that only increases boredom with the passing of time.

The characters...extremely cookie-cutter as per RPG standards. They're supposed to carve an identity of themselves, but to me, I can just sum them up as just being cardboard cut-outs in the skewed sense of genericness. You got the usual Hero who's dense and only strikes like a ferocious dog, the mercenaries of a beautiful magicians (one attuned to the Hero for ""romance"" eye-candy, another for childlike childishness) and the occasional warrior for extra strength (and seeking revenge from his past). The only consolation I'll give is the sympathy to the Dark Elves' side for much they've suffered and seeking their own justice for being the oppressed, and that's about it.

The animation...just undercuts the entire production run as a whole, because it's the same amount of mediocre as you'd expect from a decades-old studio that other than most modern-day mediocre-average kids' shows, doesn't know how to tackle a series that is vastly different from the pedigree of works before and after it. Even worse, with the surmise and acquisition of Xebec under Sunrise, and resurrection under a new name (Sunrise Beyond), I know that Xebec has done some great dark-esque shows, but the result of this is nowhere to be seen. So yeah, heck this one as well, because the animation and visuals are subpar.

Even the music is boring as well. This is one of those times that fripSide's song just somehow doesn't click well with the entire theme of the show, yes the song is somewhat listenable but nope, the mesh is just crude, and I don't care much for KOTOKO's ED...so a strike out for the ED, which makes the 1st half's OST sound palpitable. The 2nd half's OST sounded a lot better-suited to the show, and yeah, you can hear the difference in both OP and ED songs, so that's a tick.

Nope, anime adaptations from games are supposed to make you feel welcomed to the game itself, as if you're the MC who's playing the game and making decisions yourself, but to see an adaptation like this that serves no purpose other than clickbait for the actual game, why bothering making this show for the intention of the audience to suffer more than twice the length of a bad show? It all comes down to the saying of ""Money as the root of all evil"", and this is no different.

Skip this one and save your precious time, you would not want to watch more than a cour's worth of this gosh-darn slow-as-molasses bull-crap.

Mixed Feelings 
                Recommendation: You can probably skip this one unless you're desperate for a new fantasy series to watch.  It's not that it's bad exactly, more that it's inessential, and everything that's good about it is done better by other shows.

King's Raid is a series that is basically fine, but is absolutely crying out for something to make it unique.  If you can imagine a completely generic and predictable fantasy anime in your head, this is basically that series.  The main plot has basically two tracks, and the main one is as straightforward as it gets.  Kasel is searching for the Holy Sword
                  ...
to defeat the Dark Lord.  He has to journey to meet 3 different people and prove his worth to each one to unseal the sword before the Dark Lord is revived.  If you weren't aware already that this was a video game adaptation, it's unmistakable once you start watching.  The B plot, following the Black Edge mercenary company and their revenge conspiracy against the Kingdom of Orvelia, is considerably more interesting, but ultimately ends in disappointment when it merges with the main story a little past the halfway point of the series.

There are a couple of teases that the series will become more interesting or complex at times, but it never actually comes to fruition.  It can be quite frustrating to watch because it feels like it could have been a much better series if there were more of a follow through on certain parts, character relationships and so on.  There's a lot of wasted potential.

The art and animation were also a bit disappointing.  The character designs actually look fine for the most part, but some characters can be a bit dead-eyed.  The really unfortunate part is the mediocre animation of the action scenes, which feel sluggish and lack smoothness.

While the series overall is fairly mediocre, it's not entirely without strong points.  I would hesitate to call any of the characters ""great"", and the main character Kasel is almost totally without personality, but there are a lot of fun secondary characters in this series.  Cleo is best girl and gets the most to do of any of the side characters except Frey, but there are plenty of others, including Maria, Scarlet and Reina, that make the show fun when they show up too.

Most importantly, the 2nd OP absolutely slaps.  Eclipse by Dreamcatcher is the name, and it's worth looking up even if you don't watch the show.  I am not generally a fan of anime music or K pop groups, and really don't even like rock/power ballads as a genre that much, but this one is great.

Mixed Feelings 
                Herbivorous dragon is a light-hearted, cute, and feel-good show about a wimpy, kind-hearted dragon and an overpowered cute little girl who follows him. The show does a good job of giving an enjoyable experience with a consistent tone that is silly and endearing and cute. What it lacks is depth. It's a show that you can watch and be happy and then move on; you are not going to stop and go, whoa, what did I just watch?

The dragon is kind of like King, from One Punch Man, because people think he's powerful when he's a wimp. And Lingzi (Reiko) is kind of like Saitama,
                  ...
but subject to the mind warping field and also believes the dragon is powerful (and evil). So, you might imagine some of the antics that follow. It's not something you can take seriously, because real people have reasons for their beliefs, but if you let it go, it's pretty funny. I said ""antics"" because nothing in the plot feels central to the plot. It's sort of slice-of-life-ish in that regard.

The animation is simple. Don't expect any breathtaking sakuga. It looks low cost, with limited movement. The characters look nice enough though. Somehow, they make it work, without looking bad.

I have no qualms with the voice acting. Dragon has a soothing avuncular voice, and Lingzi has a cute but dauntless voice which fit their characters.

The ED is a total banger. It's no exaggeration to say that it possibly kept me watching the show. I often skip EDs after hearing them a few times, but not this one. I rewind and watch/listen to it several times per episode. The OP is also good. Note that the art style is much simpler but more animated in the OP and ED than the show.

It's short, so if you consider that it's less than three hours, I'd say it's worth the watch.

                Here is my review of this anime in 2022!

Story (9)
The story is about a dragon who's a vegetarian and is worshipped by humans as an evil dragon. But actually, He's not an evil dragon and then the dragon encounters a girl who's going to suicide since She's doesn't have a purpose in Her life. Then that's where the journey begins. There is a lot of comedy and action on their journey you can watch it every episode.

Art (10)
The art in this anime is very good! I love the animation they make, mostly it's animated and less using static images. Not only that, but they also
                  ...
have a nice glow, shadow, etc effect.

Sound (9)
All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation.

Character (9)
The main and supporter character is memorable since they have unique personality. I love the dragon and the girl mostly.

Enjoyment (10)
It's delightful to watch this movie in 2022. I don't know why the rating is so bad, but I love this anime so much! The also have less duration than normal anime.

Overall (9)
It's recommended to those who love fantasy, magic, comedy, and action anime!

Mixed Feelings 
                Plot: A several thousand year old Herbivorous Dragon is woken up one day when a local village has sent a girl to be his sacrifice, believing him to be an evil dark dragon. No matter how many times the dragon tries to convince people or tell his side of the story, and explain that he is just a wimpy herbivore, no one believes him due to his stature and the assumptions that have based around dragons. 

This is just a light-hearted and comedic anime. You will not be blown away by anything, but for what it's worth, it is funny. Lingzi, the little girl who
                  ...
was supposed to be the sacrifice, is kind of an absolute idiot, but has immense magical power and everyone just assumes that it is the dragons magic after he 'made her his disciple' and 'ate her soul'. 

I just couldn't really connect with this series cause it felt kind of boring beyond the fact of the comedic humor. I know it is the point of the series, but just seeing everyone consecutively being an idiot kind of pushes me off of the show entirely. The wimpy dragon was funny to watch get into these absurdly dumb situations when he is verbally telling people what he really is and no one listens long enough to actually receive the words that he is saying. The action, while it was interesting, it wasn't anything to really grasp me or make me feel like I NEEDED to watch more. 

There are plenty of Chinese anime series' that I enjoyed, but this one just didn't really do anything for me other than provide background noise while I was doing something else. For being only 13 minutes an episode, I can't totally convince you that it's not worth watching, as for being less than 3 hours long, there are some pretty funny moments. I would just not recommend going into this with high expectations or some miraculous journey/story/lesson to learn. 

Animation: 7/10
Art: 6/10

Characters: 4/10
Voice Acting: 7/10

Synopsis
                      While the veteran adventurers slay the hobgoblins and Goblin Champions, Goblin Slayer fights the Goblin Lord alone, but is defeated. However, when Goblin Slayer is about to be killed, Priestess casts two Protection spells to trap the Goblin Lord. The Goblin Lord attempts to trick Priestess by begging for mercy, but this fails and Goblin Slayer kills him; it's revealed that this was all part of his plan, acting as bait so Priestess could entrap the Lord. After all the Goblins are killed and the farm secured, the adventurers return to the Guild to celebrate, where Goblin Slayer confides to Cow Girl he has started to pick up interest in becoming an adventurer. He removes his helm by Priestess' request as her reward, and the other adventurers are surprised to see his face for the first time. In the epilogue, Priestess narrates that Goblin Slayer is just another pawn on the board to the gods, but the gods have taken an interest in him due to his refusal to let the gods roll the dice on his actions, meaning his fate is completely unknown to them. She then remarks Goblin Slayer is still out there fighting.

Synopsis
                      Goblin Slayer concludes that a horde of over a hundred goblins will attack the farm soon. He warns Cow Girl he cannot fight that many goblins in the open and urges her to run, but she refuses to abandon her home for a second time. Goblin Slayer heads to town to ask the other adventurers for help. They refuse at first, since there's no quest or reward posted for fighting the goblin horde. Goblin Slayer then offers everything he owns: equipment, assets, knowledge, and time, as the reward for helping him fight. Sensing how serious Goblin Slayer is about the situation, Spearman and Witch agree to fight with him, as well as the two rookie adventurers Goblin Slayer helped, and Goblin Slayer's party also joins without question, for the rewards of food or drink afterward or him joining an adventure. Guild Girl then announces that she's posted a bounty for one gold for each dead goblin, which convinces the rest of the adventurers to join. Goblin Slayer warns the adventurers the horde is being led by a Goblin Lord, a highly intelligent goblin that specializes in leadership. He devises an effective strategy for the adventurers to fight the horde, and the first few waves of goblins are easily defeated. The Goblin Lord then sends a number of hobgoblins and Goblin Champions at the adventurers and attempts to flee, but is intercepted by Goblin Slayer.

EditSynopsisGoblins are known for their ferocity, cunning, and rapid reproduction, but their reputation as the lowliest of monsters causes their threat to be overlooked. Raiding rural civilizations to kidnap females of other species for breeding, these vile creatures are free to continue their onslaught as adventurers turn a blind eye in favor of more rewarding assignments with larger bounties.

To commemorate her first day as a Porcelain-ranked adventurer, the 15-year-old Priestess joins a band of young, enthusiastic rookies to investigate a tribe of goblins responsible for the disappearance of several village women. Unprepared and inexperienced, the group soon faces its inevitable demise from an ambush while exploring a cave. With no one else left standing, the terrified Priestess accepts her fate—until the Goblin Slayer unexpectedly appears to not only rescue her with little effort, but destroy the entire goblin nest. 

As a holder of the prestigious Silver rank, the Goblin Slayer allows her to accompany him as he assists the Adventurer's Guild in all goblin-related matters. Together with the Priestess, High Elf, Dwarf, and Lizardman, the armored warrior will not rest until every single goblin in the frontier lands has been eradicated for good.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]EditBackgroundBased on the light novel series written by Kumo Kagyu, published by SoftBank Creative since February 15, 2016. The series has been adapted to a manga written by Kosuke Kurose, published by Square Enix since May 25, 2016. Both the light novels and manga have been published in English by Yen Press.

                “I don’t know if I’ll be able to save it, but let’s kill some Goblins.” — Goblin Slayer

<ahem> “So, where are the goblins?” — Goblin Slayer

The genius of Goblin Slayer comes from its uninhibited objective to underscore the savagery of the goblins; thereby, forcing the audience to immediately empathize with the lowly adventurers who’s virginities will be forever lost to those disgusting green chodes.  The first episode may have been a bit overwhelming, but it was necessary to highlight the evil nature of the goblins.  And boy, were they ever evil.  But when all hope seemed lost, the vigilante known as Goblin
                  ...
Slayer entered the proverbial arena, to lay-the-smack-down on all their candy asses.  And layeth-the-smack-down he did.  Essentially, if you think about, he’s the Japanese equivalent of Batman — mother f—king BATMAN, people — set in a medieval world.  It’s f—king awesome!  But instead of breaking bones and scaring his foes psychologically, the Goblin Slayer just straight up murders those little dick-wads.

Along with his ruthless nature, the Goblin Slayer utilizes a myriad of techniques to kill goblins and keep the viewer entertained, including: curb-stomping goblin teeth against jagged rocks; rearranging goblin face’s with his knuckles; splattering goblin brain matter across cave walls; shooting arrows through goblin eyeballs; and performing a mass genocide of all goblins, including the young-lins (NOT THE YOUNG-lins!).  Also, the Goblin Slayer’s battle armor looks amazing, and his sturdy resolve to remain a “goblin-slayer,” despite the ridicule of his fellow (ASSHOLES!) Compatriots was admirable.  His heart is filled with a deep hatred for those vile creatures, and people calling him an “edge-lord” simply don’t understand how traumatizing of an experience he went through.  If the anime community had any inkling of what empathy was, then they would know what time it is.  But the Goblin Slayer knows: it’s f—king goblin-slaying time!  Amirite.

The genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the formation of a great coalition of diversified talents and people to accelerate the slaying of even more goblins.  Simply put, they paired the Goblin Slayer with a lizard-dude, a flat-chested elf, a geriatric dwarf, and Onna the high “priestess” to go on a super-cool adventure to destroy an enormous goblin nest.  When the elf-girl used her magic to guide the single arrow through the two goblins and a wolf, I was straight up marking out.  Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!  (Ric Flair style).  But the episode wasn’t over quite yet, because just as my erection was at its limit, they started playing epic rock music as the main crew walked towards the Goblin den with bad intentions, enough weapons to terrify the whole country of France, and a whole lot of awesomeness.  Schwing!!!!!!  Party time, bitches!

But, alas….it’ not all good, dear friends (friends only include people who have Goblin Slayer in their favorites list).  Episode five deviated from the norm, omitting the Goblin Slayer’s main objective in lieu of a silly side quest by some arbitrary character’s.  EXCUSE ME!  Are we watching “Goblin Slayer” or “Pummel a Rat With a Giant Club Because You’re Too Incompetent to Pull Your Sword From a Dead Rat Carcass…Slayer?”  The show, obviously, lost its focus, leaving the viewer in a deep pit of despair, wondering if the Goblin Slayer would ever resume his normal duties of goblin slaying (#depressed).  This sort of blunder would have been unforgivable, if not for the following episode when the MOTHER F—KING Goblin Slayer lit those goblins up like a Christmas tree…….wi-with his sword (it makes SENSE!).

The genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the application of Sun Tzu’s, “The Art of War,” via the Goblin Slayer’s willingness to think like a goblin (i.e. “To know your enemy, you must become your enemy”); hence, why the Goblin Slayer used goblin blood to conceal his own scent and displayed an indifferent, callousness during his various killing-sprees.  In addition, his level of perception to distinguish between goblins and non-goblins was especially on point, rarely finding himself in a situation where he cannot fulfill his goblin killing responsibilities.  Developments throughout the series highlight the contemplative side of the Goblin Slayer, as it’s revealed that the internal goblins inside his head haunt him — “Bullshit.” — inspire him to become enraged and go on the greatest goblin slaying spree of all time.

The genius of Goblin Slayer comes from its beautiful blend of “happy,” vibrant colors of the real world, juxtaposed with the dark, bloodcurdling atmosphere of the real-er world.  The contrast exemplifies the duality of life itself and how transient bliss can be supplanted by life long despair, due to circumstances that are beyond our control.  The Goblin Slayer experienced a fate worse than death, having witnessed the gang rape and eventual death of his sister.  Instead of acquiescing to his own fears, the Goblin Slayer hardened his resolve, choosing to never forgive the creatures that robbed him of his remaining family and his innocence.  The Goblin Slayer, himself, is not an exceptionally powerful warrior, nor is he blessed with unique gifts/powers that elevate him to the status of being “one of a kind” (perpetuating the Stock Shōnen Hero archetype).  What makes the Goblin Slayer “special,” is his devotion — some may call it, insanity — to exterminate every last goblin in existence and make no apologies about it.  Just as Michael Jordan etched his name in history as the G.O.A.T with his unmatched competitive fervor, the Goblin Slayer’s inexorable zeal to eradicate his mortal enemy, is an unparalleled intensity that instills fear in his adversaries and certitude in his comrades.  

The genius of Goblin Slayer comes from the tactical vision and strategic planning of the Goblin Slayer.  His ability to foresee goblin battle plans and construct effective countermeasures, validates his meticulous nature and his profound cognitive capacity.  While other adventurers were caught off-guard by the goblin riders and the goblin champions, the Goblin Slayer, in all his clairvoyant glory, ensnared the repulsive creatures with his superior traps and delegation of responsibility; thus, paving the way for his final showdown with the Goblin Lord.  A showdown, in which the Goblin Slayer harnessed all his rage and pent-up frustration to fuel his fighting spirit to its absolute maximum.  

So why, you may ask, does the community hate the Goblin Slayer?  Detractors have argued that the Goblin Slayer’s combative fury embodies the worst aspects of the “Unstoppable Rage” archetype.  You know, the same “Unstoppable Rage” every Shōnen hero experiences when they lose their shit and unlock a dormant power they never realized they had, until that very moment when they needed it most.  In addition, they claim that the excessive amount of fan-service has been rather excessive.  Excessive or not, the fan-service has been a point, with a plethora of great camera angles and side boob action to boot.  Lastly, they assert that none of the characters exhibit a genuine personality, or display any growth throughout the series.

Because Goblin Slayer is the hero the MAL community deserves, but not the one it needs right now, so we’ll ridicule him.  Because he can bear it, because he’s not a hero.  He’s a stoic defender, a warrior-savant, an ardent gladiator, a competitive eccentric, an iron-clad inspiration….

a GOBLIN SLAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYEERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!

Mixed Feelings 
                Another fun little romp through fantasy-land, quests to be ventured and gold to be reaped... or maybe not quite. 

Welcome to 2018's most controversial anime, Goblin Slayer. Little known by western anime fans, it came much out of nowhere, with a first episode that made viewers aghast and the social medias ablaze. And why, you may ask. I will have to leave that unanswered for a moment, as you should not yet be reading this review if you are unfamiliar with what scene I am referring to. But I will leave a word of caution: you should probably not watch Goblin Slayer if you are
                  ...
easily disturbed. 

Spoilers of the first episode, necessarily, will follow. 

What transpires in the first episode overshadows everything that comes in the following eleven episodes. And so, this review will be centered primarily on the first episode and its resulting controversy. Though I will also be discussing the artistic merits of the anime as a whole, this will be as much a critical analysis as it is a response, an answer of sorts to whether the controversy Goblin Slayer brewed ever had any meaning in the first place. 

And, I will tell you, no, it really did not.

From the second episode onward, a 'viewer discretion' warning appears in the subtitles provided by Crunchy Roll. But nowhere does it appear in the show itself, in Japanese. It is quite clear who was actually offended by this show... and it was not the Japanese audience, for whom this anime was made.

I'm going to be quite blunt, as this perception that westerners' views are always, unquestionably important is bothersome. Japanese anime studios do not care about what English-speaking YouTubers have to say, for they cannot even understand them in the first place. They do not care about Tumblr, nor do they care about anyone except viewers in Japan who could potentially buy BluRay discs of their series. They are companies, not political organisations. They are from Japan, not from the United States. The only thing the west could do to make an anime studio utter more than a flippant 'oops, sorry' is to have a spot on CNN or some other giant television network, in the same vein as the infamous adult game, 'Rapelay'. So, unfortunately, if you think yourself a sort of champion of justice, destined to rid the world of all portrayals and even mentions of rape, in countries you have never even visited and which do not share your beliefs— then, sorry to say, your words have fallen upon deaf ears.

If you have ever played a visual novel, read adult-oriented manga or watched an R-18 anime (and the Japanese audience for Goblin Slayer most certainly has), then sexual assault, as vile and irredeemable an act as it is, is not particularly unusual or shocking. I suppose it may be shocking in the context of Goblin Slayer being a TV anime, in which these sorts of acts are seldom depicted. But you also have to keep in mind that Goblin Slayer airs past midnight on a weekend, well into the usual watershed hours of western television. Kids are not meant to be watching this in the first place. And sexual assault is not rare in late-night anime so much because it is 'going overboard', but because the anime community in Japan is obsessed with the concept of virginity and do not take kindly to their imaginary characters being touched by a man other than them. Hence, the reason for why sex is not so much as mentioned in non-erotic anime, whether it be consensual or not. If sex is not graphically depicted (i.e. genitals showing and thrusting and all), then it is, generally speaking, safe to air past midnight on Japanese television. Goblin Slayer's now infamous scene, unpleasant as it is to watch, was not especially graphic. It did not black-out and fast-forward to the end as most anime do, and so while this scene is not entirely innocent (true, it is difficult to not feel at least a little bit sick in the stomach), it is hardly the traumatic viewing experience that some claim it to be. Say, for example, ""13 Reasons Why"", a western Netflix series, was far, far more graphic in its depiction of similar subjects and yet it was extremely popular among western teenagers, particularly females. But when an obscure late-night anime aimed at a completely different culture, and with drawings instead of real actors, tries to tread the same waters? Take it down. Take it all down, they say. Right. Good luck with that one. 

I suppose the deeper question, then, is whether these scenes were actually necessary. I highly doubt these scenes were meant to be erotic, to arouse its viewers when they were preceded by a brutal stabbing and a brutal massacre. And the attempted rape that follows the first is abominable enough that it defies any and all human logic, clearly meant to invoke deep feelings of hatred for goblins rather than a boner-pop and an ""oh yeah, baby, show me more."" Goblin Slayer showed these scenes to create a sense of danger and to make you root for the titular character's, uh, titular slaying of said goblins. And fair enough. But equally fair is the question of why they chose rape in particular, rather than some other wretched act that would make you want to see goblin heads hitting the floor. Hatred was necessary for the story to continue, but not so much rape itself. My guess is the author chose that route because other fantasy series such as Re:Zero have already done the same with violence alone. The author wanted to set their series apart, to invoke a sort of hatred that anime-only viewers have rarely or perhaps never experienced before, and, well, the result of that is laid bare for all to see: angry westerners, and Japanese fans who just want to see some dead-ass goblins.

It is not so much from an artistic perspective that I am defending the author's choice, however. Gratuitous and pretentious, it is, when what follows in the later episodes is of little importance and does not in any meaningful way make use of the hatred instilled in the audience. Rather, it returns to the exact same silly and carefree tone of the anime's opening few minutes, as if it what happened in the first episode was just some sort of dream. Heck, the second episode may as well have been the beginning episode— the first completely obliterated from existence— and little would change at all with regards to the story and the characters. Goblin Slayer does not contain much in the way of themes other than 'goblins suck' and 'revenge begets revenge', and the trauma the heroine experienced during her first encounter is hardly touched upon or even acknowledged afterwards. Indeed, after an experience that horrifying, you would expect the heroine to, if nothing else, be apprehensive about another goblin slaying adventure, but by the next day she gives almost zero damns and throws herself to the protagonist's side merely because he is tough and can protect her, I guess? A bit of an idiot, indeed. Other characters will casually talk about their traumatic experiences as the camera pans lustfully over their breasts... almost as if it is a joke, making it pretty well clear the anime has no intention of taking these issues seriously. How are you supposed to care for characters that don't even know how to care about themselves? In the end, the main thing that sets the rest of the anime (everything sans the first episode) apart from any other fantasy series is the level of blood involved. Goblin Slayer is a strong dude, the heroine is cute, and screw goblins— there you go, Goblin Slayer's deep themes interpreted by yours truly. 

If a darker fantasy anime in the lieu of Berserk is something you are clamoring for (as, well, there really are not a whole lot of them), then Goblin Slayer is if nothing else a serviceable adventure. The titular protagonist, Goblin Slayer, is essentially a more calm and composed version of Guts from Berserk: taciturn, a dark past, filled with hatred and a desire for vengeance, armor and all... albeit with a sword a size that humans can actually wield. His cold but logical manner of speaking are refreshing in a genre that is largely defined by self-righteous protagonists spouting idealistic nonsense. Goblin Slayer will save whom he can, but he is also capable of recognising the limits of his power and putting those with mortal wounds out of their misery. He knows that fighting requires planning and a clear head just as much as it requires strength. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth is his way of living, but he does not try to moralise his lifestyle, instead believing that his endless lust for revenge makes him just as violent and as brutal as the goblins themselves. He has a sort of awareness and intellect that most anime protagonists lack, which makes the desolate world he lives in feel just a little bit more authentic. But those who are not a fan of darker or more morally ambiguous protagonists will only find the anime more unappealing with his presence. ""Edgy"", ""pretentious"", others might say. Considering that one's enjoyment of Goblin Slayer is almost entirely decided by their interest in the protagonist, and consequently his goblin slaying journey, those who do not find these sorts of characters appealing are well within their right to dislike the anime as a whole. But to say he is dark merely for the sake of being dark would be something of a lie. No, he is dark because he grew up in an awful world with rapey, murderous goblins. 

Considering the natural path for most fantasy anime is to gradually hunt stronger and stronger monsters, the fact that Goblin Slayer is perpetually chasing weaker monsters— goblins— and even being ostracised for it by his fellow adventurers, is a refreshing change of pace for a genre that is often so predictable that you can already guess the events of the final episode based on the first. Sure, those in search of climactic fights may find themselves bored with an adventure that stays at largely the same difficulty level for its entire duration (with the rare boss battle here and there), but then again, how many times does one need to see a big bad dude or a dragon slain before they are satisfied? While most anime increase the stakes as the opponents get stronger, Goblin Slayer is able to portray weak little creatures as menacing, something few anime do, slimes and goblins brushed aside as if it is a necessity. The issue is that Goblin Slayer, despite it having a clear, singular focus with goblins as the villain, never really does or say a whole lot with them. They are almost entirely identical to one another, existing to rape, kill or be killed and little else. When the antagonist of a story lacks a motive and a personality, it's kinda hard to care much about where things go in the end. 

Goblin Slayer is neither horrible nor is it great. And sometimes it is both. Putting aside all the noise surrounding the series, and looking at it as a piece of fiction like any other, what is left is merely a decent dark-fantasy anime. Its artistic merit is hardly comparable to its big brother, Berserk, and while there are very severe issues afflicting the show, in a season where truly abysmal, irredeemable rubbish such as ""Ore ga Suki nano wa Imouto dakedo Imouto ja Nai"" has aired, Goblin Slayer is not what I could consider a bad anime. There's enough of interest here with the protagonist and the setting that I am at least considering reading the light novels in Japanese, where perhaps things are a bit better explained. Those regarding Goblin Slayer as the worst anime they've seen are more likely than not fishing for attention by exaggerating their opinions as much as possible. Either that, or they have just not watched a whole lot of anime, I would have to guess. 

But to say I am a fan of Goblin Slayer, or that I even liked it would to be as dishonest as saying I hated it. My defense of Goblin Slayer is my defense of the author's right to artistic freedom. Being offended by this show is reasonable. Using said offense to try and shut down an author's livelihood, or to generalise an entire country of 130 million people as perverts or as morally bankrupt, is not. Some may even say it is despicable. And, you know, I think there is some truth in that. 

So, feel free to watch Goblin Slayer if you enjoy dark-fantasy and have a tolerance for uncomfortable content. Or skip it, because truth told, Goblin Slayer was never really worth caring that much about in the first place.

Goblin Slayer is a series that, paradoxically, is underrated because of how popular it is. Popularity means a wide audience, which means a wide array of factually wrong, uninformed opinions that slander a good work of fiction. Here is a shortlist of the popular statement about this show that are simply not true:
“It’s a generic isekai” - no, it’s this thing called “fantasy” that actually existed even before SAO. What makes it silier is that Goblin Slayer doesn’t even feature any of the staple isekai tropes like some other “fantasy confused for isekai” series, e. g. Danmachi. In reality, Goblin
                  ...
Slayer is an anime adaptation of a boilerplate D&D campaign, and is written as such.
“It’s a bad adaptation” - no, it’s a good adaptation, as long as you know what is the actual source material. Goblin Slayer is a light novel series that has a non-faithful manga adaptation and a faithful anime adaptation. Some people read the manga first, compare the anime to it, find out that it’s different and arrive to the “bad adaptation” conclusion. Which is silly in itself, faithfulness is not what decides how good an adaptation is, but it’s not even the point.
“It’s edge-fest/fetishistic porn/literally neo-nazi propaganda” - that’s just silly. Goblin Slayer is a run-of-the-mill R-rated show, its darkness level is miles below dark fantasy series like Berserk and light years below dedicated misery porn shows that are actually trying to be dark on purpose. The expectation for Goblin Slayer to be a generic isekai apparently lead to many people accidentally being exposed to the first R-rated series in their life.
“It baits you with the gory first episode and then becomes generic SoL” - that’s simply a lie. Many things throughout the show are darker than what happens in the first episode. Also a complaint that the show is not edgy enough is just silly in the context of the previous paragraph. As a D&D campaign, Goblin Slayer alternates between sorties into the wild and recuperating at the base. And (surprise, surprise) bad things tend to happen in the middle of the monster-infested dungeons, not in the middle of a peaceful town. It’s called realism.

Brushing the nonsense aside, I want to emphasize what makes this show good:

Goblin Slayer perfectly captures the spirit of a D&D campaign - that is, the spirit of murder-hoboing, with all the glorious total party kills, rule-lawyering and cheesing of the encounters. You can constantly see deliberately written moments where the players are implied to be rolling the dice, and how good of a roll that was based on the outcome.

It is a well-written dark fantasy in a market where this commodity is in deficit. Many little details show that a lot of thought and research was put into world building. While it’s not quite on the speculative fiction level, it comes pretty close to being a D&D setting written as a real functioning world.

A unique and fascinating main character and his character arc. The premise initially implies that Goblin Slayer is going to be a faceless killing machine. He was born to be a completely unremarkable average person, but then a single event radically changes his life making him fanatically focus on a single goal (of killing goblins) in favor of which he abandons everything else, including growing into a well-adjusted human being. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t a human being, or even that he is crazy. The foundations to lead a normal life are there, and the more Goblin Slayer comes in contact with other people, the more he grows, becoming more and more complex and constantly re-evaluating what he is.

Good adaptation. Not slavish adaptation, but actually good adaptation. Things are swapped around and changed to accomodate episode length and season length limitations, thus having a proper story arc in 12-episodes format. Between the things that are the point of anime medium - fight scenes choreography, music, voice acting - the former two are great. And while the latter is nothing to write home about, hearing Priestess say Goburin Sureiya-san is a reason enough for an anime adaptation to exist. Also, main character’s model is CGI and it looks fine unless you hate CGI on religious principle, not based on how it looks. For those who desire faithfulness, the anime is more faithful than the manga, which has an annoying manner of randomly changing characters’ reactions/behavior, therefore changing the characters themselves and making them look inconsistently written.

9/10 because this series succeeds in what it tries to achieve with basically no issues.

                  This is just a simple prequel to the first School Rumble.

  By the title School Rumble you know if you should watch or not. This is a prequel to School Rumble. It follows the crazy antics of Tenma, Yakumo, Harima and everyone else but mostly the first three. Honestly this anime is built on gags and there isn't really a story so I believe I'm grading the story based on the humor. The gags are somewhat funny. The best one being the Prehistoric Rumble gag. Otherwise, the rest of the OVA is....blargh. There really isn't much of the laugh-out-loud comedy that
                  ...
I saw in the original series and it just begins to lag. At first I saw this as a gread addition to the series but it was just...there. It was nice to see how Yakumo honestly feels about guys (apparently she can read mens minds). Honestly passable gags.

 The artwork isn't anything to brag about. As you may already know School Rumble is NOT known for their artwork. The chibi's were oddly enough well drawn and looked very clean and made the transition well. The artwork for the OVA is better than the series itself. The opening and endings have the same artwork but still seem crisp. The ending for the first episode of the OVA includes a train that actually made my jaw drop. It was so simple and basic but so vibrant at the same time.

 The audio is of course, normal. Actually I like the dubs for English alot better. Tenma sounds cute, but annoying just like her character is meant to be. All the other characters are normal and it's hard to hear what they say at times since two characters speak at the same time on occasion. Harima sounds like a San Francisco yakuza and Yakumo sounds like a stoic introvert. Well, what am I saying the parts are perfect. The BGM is a bit annoying though. The little transition noises tend to get in the way of what someone is saying. Pretty good dub.

  Oh, boy the characters. If you haven't seen the original series I wouldn't recommend starting here. Even though this is a prequel you won't be able to understand who's who or who likes who {other than Harima ->Tenma -> Karasuma). Everyone's here in the anime of stereotypes: Tough guy, ditz, rich girl, stoic Stacy, pervert, ""I WANNA MARRY HER!"" guy, and everyone else. But this is this anime's thing. It's supposed to be like that. I can't hold it accountable for something it's meant to be.

  You know, this is an okay OVA. Worth the watch if you're an anime completionist like myself. Otherwise go see the first and second season. This OVA isn't terrible, just passable. You can watch this when you've run out of anime to watch.

Pros:
- Wacky character antics.
- Even wackier characters.
- Excellent dubbing.

Cons:
- The gags aren't very funny.
- Passable.

This anime receives 7 ""What are classmates?"" out of 10.

                I started out watching the School Rumble anime (English sub, I unfortunately don’t understand the Japanese language) and really just expected it to be what it appeared to be – a funny comedy anime. I was partially right about that, but also VERY wrong. School Rumble, on the surface, doesn’t seem very serious. But so many things underneath the surface of it are very serious and insightful and even deeply moving. Soon after starting the anime I was hooked, and almost immediately related to Harima Kenji and began cheering him on to accomplish his goal. Throughout the beginning and middle of the series we see
                  ...
Harima failing over and over at his attempts to confess his feelings to Tenma. At first it’s laughable how silly and avoidable the misunderstandings are. Then as the series continues and you begin to see the toll it takes on Harima and the amount of pain it starts to cause him it begins to get less and less bearable to watch. Of course with all the other great characters and stories in School Rumble you are still thoroughly hooked on the series, and besides, you feel that you have to see the series through to the end to see if Harima wins the heart of the girl he loves. You also feel you have to see what happens with Hanai, Eri, Yakumo, Ichijou, Mikoto, and all the other very well written and interesting characters. The ending of the first season makes you think Harima finally confesses his love to Tenma, but it ends up being imaginary. At this point I was physically fatigued and drained from the roller coaster of emotions and disappointments throughout the first season. But at the same time I couldn’t wait to watch the second season. The second season was great of course, although in the Harima and Tenma storyline it just got more and more painful to watch. More misunderstandings, more missed opportunities, more outside interference and assumptions of who Harima did or didn’t like from his classmates. More oblivousness from Tenma as she chases after the completely blank Karasuma. The second season wraps up with no resolution. So, disappointed and borderline depressed I watch the 3rd season, which is actually just two OVAs.

Result: Complete and utter heart wrenching emptiness. Harima has been emotionally tortured and left to die basically. Tenma is gone to America to be with Karasuma and become a nurse to take care of him because he is in the hospital there with a condition that has wiped out his memory. He doesn’t even know who she is but she still wants to be with him. Harima does not get the girl. In fact no one gets anyone. Almost every story line is left unfinished.

I was fully depressed and left with an empty feeling inside. That’s the best way I can describe it. I had to have answers. I found the manga and began reading immediately.

After reading through the ENTIRE manga and then the follow up manga “School Rumble Z” I had to face harsh reality…….there was NO conclusion. No happy couples, no loose ends tied up, no happily ever after or riding off into the sunset. Just more emptiness and depression. It was as if the characters had been killed in the prime of their lives and their futures were cut short. There is no way you can understand the way it feels unless you’ve been on this journey that is School Rumble. It’s incomparable.

I couldn’t believe it. I searched all over the internet for any and all information about School Rumble and it’s creator Jin Kobayashi. I began reaching out to fans and hearing their stories that were the same as mine. The way they felt at the end of it all was like my story. The wave of emotions: shock and disbelief, confusion, emptiness, depression, and bitterness.

There is much much more to this story. But that’s basically how I got started on this mission to reach Mr. Kobayashi. There have been moments of slight progress, and a few disappointments. Ups and downs, feeling like I’m all alone in this, and then feeling the love and support of School Rumble fans from many different countries around the world. One thing is certain, I have no plans of EVER giving up.

In closing, here’s the motto: Justice for Harima, closure for the fans, may the hero get his girl, may his spring finally come.

                It was pretty long since I watched the original season so I can’t say for sure, but it feels like I have seen most of the sketches in this OVA already. Regardless, it is what you’d expect from School rumble; great but shallow comedy. Just watching this OVA by itself isn’t really much of an experience though, as the sketches are taken from different parts of the original continuity, making it hard to follow. 

Graphics- and soundwise the OVA is identical to the series. That is: it does its job well. Giving a score in “Story” and “Characters” is rather pointless out of the context
                  ...
of the TV series, however. On its own merits, the OVA falls flat. But if you’re already into School rumble, it’s good times as usual. Giving the supporting cast a bit of extra screen time is always welcome.
