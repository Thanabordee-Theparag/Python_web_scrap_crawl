worth shot starting point adaptation really well executed protagonist someone reincarnated fact used way making know audience someone see reflected expect rational decision part also interesting ones also series doesnt start revolving around fact protagonist someone reincarnated puts fact aside instead focuses primarily conflicts within character presented example coprotagonist always putting responsibilities first leads rather despicable attitude speak even telling prince relating hoping disappoint familys name expectations people status kind attitude would expect someone high social pyramid prince brother protagonist seems like someone would go protagonist reason later instead presented someone refuses follow established rules kingdom best part reasons completely justified said led attitude seen abuse someone low social status suffers day day besides fed everything entails prince restricted taking decisions also going rebel phase problem anger feels leads make hasty decisions etc generally speaking yeah characters pretty good far dialogue really good also never felt line annoying unnecessary development story instead contributed lot developing characters contributing world building etc feels realistic thats important part example great exchange afternoon snack scene prince fiance first episode solid exchange characters simple quick course episodes solidness didnt go music ost expect fantasy anime compared osts stands along sound desing experience noticeable animation really good didnt disappoint didnt got worse later animation studio characterized much animation projects years experience really shown ways use resources extraordinary production also carried several people good track records cases working projects owarimonogatari

way expects familiar characters setting little explanation characters motives instead writers presume watched original end familiar revelations came last episodes ready digest fanfiction vash happening first scene spaceship reputation none questions answered neither would viewer able figure context significant amount indirect information dump first episodes way would give coherent picture early fully appreciate feel watching second season anime isnt sequel alternative version identity crisis alone would make watching trigun stampede standalone product pretty grating real killing blow pacing focus mindless action scenes come one another without rhyme reason honest classify think would fit definition western cartoon action flick better japanese anime without spoiling events much episodes like disconnected string random encounters moment one resolved one kicks without sufficient downtime digest happened one thing forces characters completely overhaul personality goals every five minutes coherence downright improbable events follow little time inbetween without prior coordination case therefore feels like writers completely dropped pretense realism keep audience interested mindless action scenes kids adhd guess didnt want huge animation budget go waste frankly believe text prediction ais like chatgpt could write coherent enjoyable adaptation trained original

everyone dared speak negativity soon enough questionable things got introduced girl steals clothing lives house man stalks elder brother siscon bad saves bathwater drink butler gets nosebleeds 10 year old master say least show went shocking approach episode 6 safe say plot little nothing romance anymore many shocking jokes fit one ep personally dont find matters joked stalking paedophilia incest haha im blast great resolve romance also something missed think get daydream huge character confrontation everything didnt make sense show kanade tall acts childish plot calls etc promises together forever thats also theres dog feels underage boy characters usually im sucker cute girls love moe girls make want protect kaho another dimension shes dense yet empty time 12 eps im sure character like minus fact loves kanade kanade weird crossover bishie child also character goes friends look old act young make penis jokes theres mean dude doesnt want kanade kaho date theres funky housemates interesting characters yet none ever explored enough truly likable relationship kanade kaho seems made nothing live house friends right sound ill honest one main reasons drew show cast im avid seiyu fan seeing many talented ones one show got hooked also enjoy show opening generic ending wonder romance anime ost decent reminded grade school art art decent ive seen worse ive seen better striking despite colour palette good bad moments key moments especially generic wow im love shots theyre pretty cute easily get balanced laughably bad backgrounders overall like said opening probably enjoy like decent plot finished watching waiting regain grace beginning deal whimsical weird plots plot show completely gave around episode 4 sailed onwards nothing penis jokes drama laughing expected

author hatsukoi monster clearly story 110 exactly would expect shoujo story difference parts cant stand ex melodrama breakups jealousy stupid comedy magnified tenfold couple laughs due absolute ridiculousness making 5th grade boys look like college students authors deluded dream pedophilia becoming legal story absolutely nothing offer turn away even biggest fans genre art 310 see thin hate shows like usually get good art animation could gone much deserving series luckily hatsukoi monster wasnt gifted good art animation colorful palette gives childish look think going thats good everything else subpar best sound 310 though hatsukoi monster wasnt blessed good art blessed amazing voice actors mind characters voices annoying even ones arent intentionally meant annoying said voices help bring otherwise flat characters life probably favorite part show overall though opening ending theme hopelessly bad sound effects standout character 210 oh god intolerable character cast ive seen characters didnt make want break screen kanade mafuyu gin though lets talk designs looked bishie template colored hair colors rainbow microsoft paint told editor slap couple accessories dont think would noticed difference second thought thats probably personalitywise recreations typical reverse haremshoujo story evil megane trap boy siscomplex older brother rest fifth graders cracking penis jokes like nobodies business though funny first becomes idiotic first couple times coming gintama fan however say gin kanade mafuyu manage show bit personality least consistently amusing view

ci fu first donghua ive watched entirety like many others intrigued placement top airing list alongside eager recommendations novel readers unfortunately thanks horrifically executed second arc almost nonexistent character development worst editing ive ever seen tian guan ci fu resounding disappointment two major arcs occur throughout course series first taking place course brisk three episodes better two order pay massive debt caused third ascension heaven main character xie lien travels mortal world heavenly official solve mystery ghost groom mount yujun accompanied hotheaded nan feng fu yao accounts tian guan ci fu actually really well first arc mystery well crafted suspense built right nice action sequences sprinkled mix good job drawing viewer much introductory arcs success hinges couple key points hardly worlds mechanics explained ascensionbanishment process magic formations actually goes heaven many details barely elaborated character development takes place mostly xie lien minimal although pretty forgivable since focus mystery resolution mystery lacklustre rationale behind apparitions actions less deduced xie lien reason writers decided necessary convoluted flashback backstory written something added little overall experience amount screen time took kind difficult make character morally ambiguous theyve murdered seventeen innocent brides addressing issues key initial momentum kept tian guan ci fu doesnt ignore issues flat magnifies point later episodes legitimately painful go recurring characters get zero development im exaggerating say apart basic character traits established superficial interactions really dont learn anything personalities characters biggest offenders would nan feng fu yao sole defining traits temper problems dislike result theyre also main source comic relief antics get old quickly constant yelling help world building awful constantly shifting unconnected settings largely remain unexplored real shame world really intriguing theres critical lack cohesion everything feels like arbitrary chain incidents stringed together natural progression events major reason problems stems tian guan ci fus boring flatout wasteful dialogue second arc extremely heavy dialogue dialogue worst kind sloppy exposition dumping much show spent character explaining really minor plot points intricate detail usually accompanied flashback sort time theres twist character feels need explain actions flashback feel clunky unsubtle times also eats runtime would benefited way character setting development also mindnumbingly tedious thing go double blow sorts lazy boring exposition right take much time second arc general bizarre change direction im struggling understand decision made theres much exposition much actually takes place course second arc everything moves snails pace majority exposition delivered san lang mysterious young man seemingly knows everything wellwritten dialogue convey information personality whoevers delivering concise manner laziness script means san lang joins list flavourless characters apparently theres supposed romance going san lang xie lien characters personalities wet flannels flirt clearly established reason hard get invested good editing often save scenes would otherwise slog get tian guan ci fus editing horrible editor really weird obsession fade black transitions switching scenes due taking significantly longer something like cut fade transitions major slowing effect pacing isnt greatest choice episode spends half runtime information dumping last thing need something makes things even slow paced already conversations interactions awkward characters regularly reacting unnatural time intervals theres completely inexplicable errors episode 6 theres shot involving botched looped animation xie lien walking frame mouth open cycles ten whole seconds shot xie liens mouth movements stop prematurely san langs mouth starts moving audio xie lien talking still plays speaking show consistent issue lip flap audio sync problems segment worst offender far also need mention shot happens involve one san langs many exposition dumps fact shot lasts ten seconds first place another big nono episode 10 theres shot involving girl dancing beat xie liens clapping person playing tambourine except xie liens clapping clearly match tambourine player certain episodes vas nan feng fu yao stand way close mic whenever yell happens lot hear annoying distortion effect voices really basic errors fact went unnoticed editor mindboggling times result funny crucially distracting fault honestly dont remember last time got distracted bad editing raise examples risk coming nitpicky ones think top head dont mind occasional mistake happens consistently like completely takes said like tian guan ci fu everything wrong decent wellproduced soundtrack voice actors serviceable performance mentioned earlier first arc great fact earlier episodes general fairly enjoyable benefiting greatly gorgeous backdrops fluid animation wellchoreographed fight scenes qualities degraded episodes progressed nonetheless remained reasonable level clear serious time money effort put producing makes confusing couldnt hire better editor director matter tian guan ci fus novel widely lauded readers masterful storytelling quality seem translated donghua adaptation really quite frustrating tools needed something special possible fate hinted encouraging introductory arc unfortunately show fails maintain initial high spirals lower lower abyss episodes go crashing heap end

innovative yes theres plenty better shows doesnt mean didnt like fact loved kings raid slow burn 2cours span runs gets going found entertaining context watch anime usually multitask farming fgo gacha kr one shows past two seasons actually held interest long enough put phone fully lock despite generic set chosen heir throne going quest standard jrpg party defeat demon lord thought kasel riheetos juxtaposition duel protagonists well done fact end show feeling much sympathetic towards secondary protag main guy dynamic mcs parties really fun compare contrast course anime studio aids alternating perspectives every episode also liked mystery stretch unravelling kasel riheetos pasts seemed like studio knew exactly end episodes leave edge seat wanting due nature gacha game adapdation youd expect animation meh best throughout much show vast majority 26 episodes pretty average id put hortensia saga well likes priconne even gran blue anime art really nice actually one big reasons liked show really glossy look makes characters shine lot really makes waifus show pop probably wouldnt recommend kings raid people isnt good probably would boring uninspiring others think people theres enjoyable

disappointment merges main story little past halfway point series couple teases series become interesting complex times never actually comes fruition quite frustrating watch feels like could much better series follow certain parts character relationships theres lot wasted potential art animation also bit disappointing character designs actually look fine part characters bit deadeyed really unfortunate part mediocre animation action scenes feel sluggish lack smoothness series overall fairly mediocre entirely without strong points would hesitate call characters great main character kasel almost totally without personality lot fun secondary characters series cleo best girl gets side characters except frey plenty others including maria scarlet reina make show fun show importantly 2nd op

pretty long since watched original season cant say sure feels like seen sketches ova already regardless youd expect school rumble great shallow comedy watching ova isnt really much experience though sketches taken different parts original continuity making hard follow graphics soundwise ova identical series job well giving score story characters rather pointless context tv series however merits ova falls flat youre already school rumble good times usual giving supporting cast bit extra screen time always welcome reviewers rating 7 think review nice 0 love 0 funny 0 confusing 0 informative 0
